0,1,Noonan syndrome. What are the references with noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease,"Noonan syndrome: Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that prevents normal development in various parts of the body. A person can be affected by Noonan syndrome in a wide variety of ways. These include unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, other physical problems and possible developmental delays. Noonan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation and is acquired when a child inherits a copy of an affected gene from a parent (dominant inheritance). It can also occur as a spontaneous mutation, meaning there's no family history involved. Management of Noonan syndrome focuses on controlling the disorder's symptoms and complications. Growth hormone may be used to treat short stature in some people with Noonan syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly among individuals and may be mild to severe. Characteristics may be related to the specific gene containing the mutation. Facial appearance is one of the key clinical features that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. These features may be more pronounced in infants and young children, but change with age. In adulthood, these distinct features become more subtle. Features may include the following: - Eyes are wide-set and down-slanting with droopy lids. Irises are pale blue or green. - Ears are low-set and rotated backward. - Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and bulbous tip. - Mouth has a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peaks in the upper lip. The crease that runs from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked, the inside roof of the mouth (palate) may be highly arched and the lower jaw may be small. - Facial features may appear coarse, but appear sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and expressionless. - Head may appear large with a prominent forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. - Skin may appear thin and transparent with age. Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with some form of heart defect (congenital heart disease), accounting for some of the key signs and symptoms of the disorder. Some heart problems can occur later in life. Some forms of congenital heart disease associated with this disorder include: - Valve disorders. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, the flap of tissue that separates the lower right chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the artery that supplies blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery). It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects. - Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affects some people with Noonan syndrome. - Other structural defects of the heart. The defects can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation). - Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities. Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome can affect normal growth. Many children with Noonan syndrome don't grow at a normal rate. Issues may include the following: - Birth weight will likely be normal, but growth slows over time. - Eating difficulties may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain. - Growth hormone levels may be insufficient. - The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage years may be delayed. But because this disorder causes bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens. - By adulthood, some people with Noonan syndrome may have normal height, but short stature is more common. Some common issues can include: - An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) - Wide-set nipples - Short neck, often with extra folds of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscles (trapezius) - Deformities of the spine Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome. However, individuals may have: - An increased risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability - A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild - Hearing and vision deficits that may complicate learning A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormalities of the eyes and eyelids. These may include: - Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye (strabismus) - Refractive problems, such as astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) - Rapid movement of the eyeballs (nystagmus) - Cataracts Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficits due to nerve issues or to structural abnormalities in the inner ear bones. Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defects or having too few platelets. Noonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection. These problems: - May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage years or adulthood - Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread - Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hands or top of the feet Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problems with the genitals and kidneys. - Testicles. Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) are common in males. - Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in both boys and girls. - Fertility. Most females develop normal fertility. In males, however, fertility may not develop normally, often because of undescended testicles. - Kidneys. Kidney problems are generally mild and occur in a fairly small number of people with Noonan syndrome. People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions, which most commonly are: - Various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin - Curly, coarse hair or sparse hair The signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome can be subtle. If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician. You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal tests may be available. Noonan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation. These mutations can occur in multiple genes. Defects in these genes cause the production of proteins that are continually active. Because these genes play a role in the formation of many tissues throughout the body, this constant activation of proteins disrupts the normal process of cell growth and division. The mutations that cause Noonan syndrome can be: - Inherited. Children who have one parent with Noonan syndrome who carries the defective gene (autosomal dominant) have a 50 percent chance of developing the disorder. - Random. Noonan syndrome can develop because of a new mutation in children who don't have a genetic predisposition for the disorder (de novo). A parent with Noonan syndrome has a 50 percent chance (one chance in two) of passing the defective gene on to his or her child. The child who inherits the defective gene may have fewer or more symptoms than the affected parent. Complications can arise that may require special attention, including: - Developmental delays. If your child is affected developmentally, he or she may have difficulty with organization and spatial sense. Sometimes the developmental challenges are significant enough to require a special plan to address your child's learning and educational needs. - Bleeding and bruising. Sometimes the excessive bleeding common in Noonan syndrome isn't discovered until a person has dental work or surgery and experiences excessive bleeding. - Lymphatic complications. These usually involve excess fluid that gets stored in various places in the body. Sometimes fluid can collect in the space around the heart and lungs. - Urinary tract complications. Structural abnormalities in the kidneys may increase the risk of urinary tract infections. - Fertility issues. Males may have a low sperm count and other fertility problems because of undescended testicles or testicles that don't function properly. - Increased risk of cancer. There may be an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as leukemia or certain types of tumors. A diagnosis of Noonan syndrome is usually made after a doctor observes some key signs, but this can be difficult because some features are subtle and hard to identify. Sometimes, Noonan syndrome isn't diagnosed until adulthood, only after a person has a child who is more obviously affected by the condition. Molecular genetic testing can help confirm a diagnosis. If there's evidence of heart problems, a doctor who specializes in heart conditions (cardiologist) can assess the type and severity. Although there's no way to repair the gene changes that cause Noonan syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. Treatment of the symptoms and complications that occur with Noonan syndrome depends on type and severity. Many of the health and physical issues associated with this syndrome are treated as they would be for anyone with a similar health problem. Taken together, though, the many problems of this disorder require a coordinated team approach. Recommended approaches may include: - Heart treatment. Certain drugs may be effective in treating some kinds of heart problems. If there's a problem with the heart's valves, surgery may be necessary. The doctor also may recommend that heart function be evaluated periodically. - Treating low growth rate. Height should be measured three times a year until 3 years of age and then once every year until adulthood to make sure he or she is growing. To evaluate nutrition, the doctor will likely request blood tests. If your child's growth hormone levels are insufficient, growth hormone therapy may be a treatment option. - Addressing learning disabilities. For early childhood developmental delays, ask the doctor about infant stimulation programs. Physical and speech therapies may be helpful for addressing a variety of possible issues. In some cases special education or individualized teaching strategies may be appropriate. - Vision and hearing treatments. Eye exams are recommended at least every two years. Most eye issues can be treated with glasses alone. Surgery may be needed for some conditions, such as cataracts. Hearing screenings are recommended annually during childhood. - Treatment for bleeding and bruising. If there's a history of easy bruising or excessive bleeding, avoid aspirin and aspirin-containing products. In some cases, doctors may prescribe drugs that help the blood to clot. Notify your doctor before any procedures. - Treatment for lymphatic problems. Lymphatic problems can occur in many ways and may not require treatment. If they do require treatment, your doctor can suggest appropriate measures. - Treatment for genital problems. If one or both testicles haven't moved into proper position within the first few months of life (undescended testicle), surgery may be needed. Other evaluations and regular follow-up care may be recommended depending on specific issues, for example, regular dental care. Children, teens and adults should continue to have ongoing, periodic evaluations by their health care professional.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/noonan-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354422
1,2,"Gluten information. Re:NDC# 0115-0672-50 Zolmitriptan tabkets 5mg. I have celiac disease & need to know if these contain gluten, Thank you!","Learn about gluten-free diets: On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea. People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons: Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their GI tract. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage. Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea. If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease. If you suspect you have one of these conditions, talk with your health care provider before making any diet changes. Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven. Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve. On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products. Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including: - Fruits and vegetables - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs - Beans - Nuts and seeds - Dairy products Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings: - Quinoa - Amaranth - Buckwheat - Cornmeal - Millet - Rice You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace. When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten: - Wheat - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar) - Rye - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye) You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat: - Bulgur - Couscous - Durum flour - Farina - Graham flour - Kamut - Semolina - Spelt Note that ""wheat-free"" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy ""gluten-free"" options of: - Bread and other baked goods - Pastas - Cereals - Crackers - Beer - Soy sauce - Seitan - Breading - Battered or deep-fried foods - Oats - Packaged foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies - Some candies, licorice - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together) A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health. People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines. Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten. Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these: - Calcium - Fiber - Folate - Iron - Niacin - Riboflavin - Thiamin To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition. Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals. The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaign at celiac.nih.gov with information and resources. You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations: - Beyond Celiac -- www.beyondceliac.org - The Celiac Disease Foundation -- celiac.org There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian. If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your provider. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition. If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results. Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

2,3,amphetamine salts 20 mg. are they gluten free,"Amphetamine: Amphetamine can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much amphetamine, you may find that the medication no longer controls your symptoms, you may feel a need to take large amounts of the medication, and you may experience symptoms such as rash, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, irritability, hyperactivity, and unusual changes in your personality or behavior. Overusing amphetamine may also cause serious heart problems or sudden death. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications. Your doctor will probably not prescribe amphetamine for you. Do not stop taking amphetamine without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may develop depression and extreme tiredness. if you suddenly stop taking amphetamine after overusing it. Do not sell, give away, or let anyone else take your medication. Selling or giving away amphetamine may harm others and is against the law. Store amphetamine in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets or how much suspension (liquid) are left so you will know if any are missing. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with amphetamine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) to obtain the Medication Guide. Amphetamine (Adzenys XR, Dyanavel XR, Evekeo) is used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in adults and children. Amphetamine (Evekeo) is used to treat narcolepsy (a sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden attacks of sleep). Amphetamine (Evekeo) is also used for a limited period of time (a few weeks) along with a reduced calorie diet and an exercise plan for weight loss in obese people unable to lose weight. Amphetamine is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain. Amphetamine comes as an immediate-release tablet (Evekeo), an extended-release (long-acting) orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) (Adzenys XR), and as an extended-release (long-acting) suspension (Dyanavel XR) to take by mouth. The suspension is usually taken once daily in the morning with or without food. The extended-release orally disintegrating tablet is usually taken once daily in the morning with or without food. For treatment of ADHD or narcolepsy, the immediate-release tablet is usually taken with or without food one to three times daily, 4 to 6 hours apart, with the first dose in the morning. For weight loss, the immediate-release tablet is usually taken 30 to 60 minutes before meals. Amphetamine should not be taken in the late afternoon or evening because it may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amphetamine exactly as directed. Do not try to push the extended-release orally disintegrating tablet through the blister pack foil. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it in your mouth. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow the tablet. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. It is important to use an oral syringe (measuring device) to accurately measure and take your dose of the suspension. Ask your pharmacist for a device if it was not provided. Wash the oral syringe thoroughly after each use. If you or your child are taking amphetamine for ADHD, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, every 4 to 7 days, depending on the medication. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking amphetamine from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully. If you are taking amphetamine for narcolepsy, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, not more often than once every week. Follow these directions carefully. The medication in each product is absorbed differently by the body, so one amphetamine product cannot be substituted for another product. If you are switching from one product to another, your doctor will prescribe a dose that is best for you. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking amphetamine, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to amphetamine, other stimulant medications such as benzphetamine, dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, in Adderall), lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), and methamphetamine (Desoxyn); any other medications; or any of the ingredients in amphetamine products. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients. - tell your doctor if you are taking the following medications or have stopped taking them in the past 14 days: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors including isocarboxazid (Marplan), linezolid (Zyvox), methylene blue, phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate). If you stop taking amphetamine, you should wait at least 14 days before you start to take an MAO inhibitor. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal products you are taking. Be sure to mention any of the following: acetazolamide (Diamox); ammonium chloride; anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); ascorbic acid (Vitamin C); buspirone; medications for heartburn or ulcers such as omeprazole (Prilosec, in Zegerid); antihistamines (medications for colds and allergies); chlorpromazine; diuretics ('water pills'); fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Subsys, others); guanethidine (Ismelin; no longer available in U.S.); haloperidol (Haldol); medications for high blood pressure; lithium (Lithobid); methenamine salts (Hiprex, Urex); medications for migraine headaches such as almotriptan (Axert), eletriptan (Relpax), frovatriptan (Frova), naratriptan (Amerge), rizatriptan (Maxalt), sumatriptan (Imitrex, in Treximet), and zolmitriptan (Zomig); narcotic pain medications such as meperidine (Demerol); propoxyphene (Darvon; no longer available in U.S.); reserpine; medications for seizures such as ethosuximide (Zarontin), phenobarbital, and phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors such as citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Prozac, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), milnacipran (Savella), and venlafaxine (Effexor); sodium acid phosphate; sodium bicarbonate (Arm and Hammer Baking Soda, Soda Mint); tramadol; or tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine (Norpramin) and protriptyline (Vivactil). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. - tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort and tryptophan or nutritional supplements you are taking including glutamic acid (L-glutamine). - tell your doctor if you have hyperthyroidism (condition in which there is too much thyroid hormone in the body), or strong feelings of anxiety, tension, or agitation Your doctor will probably tell you not to take amphetamine. - tell your doctor if anyone in your family has or has ever had an irregular heartbeat or has died suddenly. Also tell your doctor if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have or have ever had a heart defect, arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart), high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiomyopathy (thickening of the heart muscles), heart or blood vessel disease, or other heart problems. Your doctor will examine you to see if your heart and blood vessels are healthy. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take amphetamine if you have a heart condition or if there is a high risk that you may develop a heart condition. - tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had depression, bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited), mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), psychosis, motor tics (repeated uncontrollable movements), verbal tics (repetition of sounds or words that is hard to control), Tourette's syndrome (a condition characterized by the need to perform repeated motions or to repeat sounds or words), or has thought about or attempted suicide. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had seizures, an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG; a test that measures electrical activity in the brain), or kidney disease. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking amphetamine, call your doctor. Do not breastfeed while taking amphetamine. - do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you. - do not drink alcohol while you are taking amphetamine. Alcohol can make the side effects from amphetamine worse. - you should know that amphetamine should be used as part of a total treatment program for ADHD, which may include counseling and special education. Make sure to follow all of your doctor's and/or therapist's instructions. - you should know that amphetamine may cause sudden death in children and teenagers, especially children and teenagers who have heart defects or serious heart problems. This medication also may cause sudden death, heart attack, or stroke in adults, especially adults with heart defects or serious heart problems. Call your or your child's doctor right away if you or your child has any signs of heart problems while taking this medication including: chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting. Talk to your doctor about drinking fruit juice while taking this medicine. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Amphetamine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - dry mouth - nausea - diarrhea - constipation - unpleasant taste - weight loss - nose bleeding - headache - grinding or clenching teeth during sleep - changes in sex drive or ability - painful menstruation - pain or burning when urinating Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms or those listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, stop taking amphetamine and call your doctor immediately: - dizziness or fainting - fast or pounding heartbeat - weakness or numbness of an arm or leg - motor or verbal tics - believing things that are not true - feeling unusually suspicious of others - hallucinating (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist) - mania (frenzied or abnormally excited mood) - agitation, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), fever, sweating, confusion, fast heartbeat, shivering, severe muscle stiffness or twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea - seizures - changes in vision or blurred vision - blistering or peeling skin - rash - hives - itching - swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, or eyes - difficulty breathing or swallowing - numbness, pain, or sensitivity to temperature in the fingers or toes - skin color change from pale to blue to red in the fingers or toes - unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes Amphetamine may slow children's growth or weight gain. Your child's doctor will watch his or her growth carefully. Talk to your child's doctor if you have concerns about your child's growth or weight gain while he or she is taking this medication. Talk to your child's doctor about the risks of giving amphetamine to your child. Amphetamine may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).

If the test is positive, the next step is to confirm the results with an FTA-ABS test, which is a more specific syphilis test. The VDRL test's ability to detect syphilis depends on the stage of the disease. The test's sensitivity to detect syphilis nears 100% during the middle stages; it is less sensitive during the earlier and later stages. Some conditions may cause a false-positive test, including: - HIV - Lyme disease - Certain types of pneumonia - Malaria - Systemic lupus erythematosus The body does not always produce antibodies specifically in response to the syphilis bacteria, so this test is not always accurate.",https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003515.htm

5,6,"ANESTHESIA EFFECT ON FXTAS PERSONS.. Does Anesthesia given during a operation severely hurt, or damage a brain for FXTAS patient? The operation would be for hip replacement! Thank you very much","Spinal and epidural anesthesia: Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic. You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly. For an epidural: - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space. - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth. - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure. For a spinal: - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed. - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures. Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk. Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures. Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when: - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine. - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet. - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure. - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications: - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma) - Difficulty urinating - Drop in blood pressure - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess) - Nerve damage - Seizures (this is rare) - Severe headache Tell your health care provider: - If you are or could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the procedure: - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before. - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners. - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure. - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic. - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. On the day of the procedure: - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours. This is to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

Also these syntoms worsened after she gave birth. This has been happening for a year now should she see discuss this with her doctor right away?","Blood Clots (Summary): Summary Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the clot. But some people get too many clots or their blood clots abnormally. Many conditions can cause the blood to clot too much or prevent blood clots from dissolving properly. Risk factors for excessive blood clotting include - Certain genetic disorders - Atherosclerosis - Diabetes - Atrial fibrillation - Overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome - Some medicines - Smoking - Staying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane ride - Cancer and cancer treatments Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and limbs. A clot in the veins deep in the limbs is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT usually affects the deep veins of the legs. If a blood clot in a deep vein breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs and blocks blood flow, it is called a pulmonary embolism. Other complications of blood clots include stroke, heart attack, kidney problems, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems.

How can I narrow my search to find information regarding pain(joint) medication suitable to use with a person who has diabetes type 2.,"Diabetes (Treatment): Type 2 diabetes may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating healthier foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes. Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level. Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator. Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke. To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having.

My genetic profile does not include any previous conditions except that I am Caucasian.","Macular Degeneration (Summary): Summary Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked. Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision. NIH: National Eye Institute",#
11,12,"molar pregnancy.. is conception a requirement of a molar pregnancy. if so, when ?","Molar pregnancy: A molar pregnancy - also known as hydatidiform mole - is a rare complication of pregnancy characterized by the abnormal growth of trophoblasts, the cells that normally develop into the placenta. There are two types of molar pregnancy, complete molar pregnancy and partial molar pregnancy. In a complete molar pregnancy, the placental tissue is abnormal and swollen and appears to form fluid-filled cysts. There's also no formation of fetal tissue. In a partial molar pregnancy, there may be normal placental tissue along with abnormally forming placental tissue. There may also be formation of a fetus, but the fetus is not able to survive, and is usually miscarried early in the pregnancy. A molar pregnancy can have serious complications - including a rare form of cancer - and requires early treatment. A molar pregnancy may seem like a normal pregnancy at first, but most molar pregnancies cause specific signs and symptoms, including: - Dark brown to bright red vaginal bleeding during the first trimester - Severe nausea and vomiting - Sometimes vaginal passage of grapelike cysts - Pelvic pressure or pain If you experience any signs or symptoms of a molar pregnancy, consult your doctor or pregnancy care provider. He or she may detect other signs of a molar pregnancy, such as: - Rapid uterine growth - the uterus is too large for the stage of pregnancy - High blood pressure - Preeclampsia - a condition that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy - Ovarian cysts - Anemia - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, an empty egg is fertilized by one or two sperm, and all of the genetic material is from the father. In this situation, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This most often occurs when two sperm fertilize an egg, resulting in an extra copy of the father's genetic material. Approximately 1 in every 1,000 pregnancies is diagnosed as a molar pregnancy. Various factors are associated with molar pregnancy, including: - Maternal age. A molar pregnancy is more likely in women older than age 35 or younger than age 20. - Previous molar pregnancy. If you've had one molar pregnancy, you're more likely to have another. A repeat molar pregnancy happens, on average, in 1 out of every 100 women. After a molar pregnancy has been removed, molar tissue may remain and continue to grow. This is called persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). This occurs in approximately 15 to 20 percent of complete molar pregnancies, and up to 5 percent of partial molar pregnancies. One sign of persistent GTN is a high level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) - a pregnancy hormone - after the molar pregnancy has been removed. In some cases, an invasive hydatidiform mole penetrates deep into the middle layer of the uterine wall, which causes vaginal bleeding. Persistent GTN can nearly always be successfully treated, most often with chemotherapy. Another treatment option is removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). Rarely, a cancerous form of GTN known as choriocarcinoma develops and spreads to other organs. Choriocarcinoma is usually successfully treated with multiple cancer drugs. A complete molar pregnancy is more likely to have this complication than a partial molar pregnancy. If your doctor suspects a molar pregnancy, he or she will order blood tests, including one to measure the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) - a pregnancy hormone - in your blood. He or she will also recommend an ultrasound. With a standard ultrasound, high-frequency sound waves are directed at the tissues in the abdominal and pelvic area. During early pregnancy, however, the uterus and fallopian tubes are closer to the vagina than to the abdominal surface, so the ultrasound may be done through a wandlike device placed in your vagina. An ultrasound of a complete molar pregnancy - which can be detected as early as eight or nine weeks of pregnancy - may show: - No embryo or fetus - No amniotic fluid - A thick cystic placenta nearly filling the uterus - Ovarian cysts An ultrasound of a partial molar pregnancy may show: - A growth-restricted fetus - Low amniotic fluid - A thick cystic placenta If your health care provider detects a molar pregnancy, he or she may check for other medical problems, including: - Preeclampsia - Hyperthyroidism - Anemia A molar pregnancy can't continue as a normal viable pregnancy. To prevent complications, the abnormal placental tissue must be removed. Treatment usually consists of one or more of the following steps: - Dilation and curettage (D and C). To treat a molar pregnancy, your doctor will remove the molar tissue from your uterus with a procedure called dilation and curettage (D and C). A D and C is usually done as an outpatient procedure in a hospital. During the procedure, you'll receive a local or general anesthetic and be positioned on the operating room table on your back with your legs in stirrups. Your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina, as in a pelvic exam, to see your cervix. He or she will then dilate your cervix and remove uterine tissue with a vacuum device. - Hysterectomy. Rarely, if there is increased risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) and there's no desire for future pregnancies, the uterus may be removed (hysterectomy). - HCG monitoring. After the molar tissue is removed, your doctor will repeat measurements of your HCG level until it returns to normal. If you continue to have HCG in your blood, you may need additional treatment. Once treatment for the molar pregnancy is complete, your doctor may continue to monitor your HCG levels for six months to one year to make sure there's no remaining molar tissue. Because pregnancy HCG levels also increase during a normal pregnancy, your doctor may recommend you wait six to 12 months before trying to become pregnant again. Your provider will recommend a reliable form of birth control during this time.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/molar-pregnancy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375175

I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Psoriatic arthritis (Diagnosis): During the exam, your doctor may: - Closely examine your joints for signs of swelling or tenderness - Check your fingernails for pitting, flaking and other abnormalities - Press on the soles of your feet and around your heels to find tender areas No single test can confirm a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. But some types of tests can rule out other causes of joint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout. Imaging tests - X-rays. Plain X-rays can help pinpoint changes in the joints that occur in psoriatic arthritis but not in other arthritic conditions. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI utilizes radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce very detailed images of both hard and soft tissues in your body. This type of imaging test may be used to check for problems with the tendons and ligaments in your feet and lower back. Laboratory tests - Rheumatoid factor (RF). RF is an antibody that's often present in the blood of people with rheumatoid arthritis, but it's not usually in the blood of people with psoriatic arthritis. For that reason, this test can help your doctor distinguish between the two conditions. - Joint fluid test. Using a needle, your doctor can remove a small sample of fluid from one of your affected joints - often the knee.

There are many things you can do to while living with fibromyalgia, including: - Getting enough sleep. - Exercising. - Adjusting your work demands. - Eating well. Getting Enough Sleep Getting enough sleep and the right kind of sleep can help ease the pain and fatigue of fibromyalgia. You may have problems such as pain, restless legs syndrome, or brainwave changes that interfere with restful sleep. It is important to discuss any sleep problems with your doctor, who can prescribe or recommend treatment. Tips for Good Sleep - Keep regular sleep habits. Try to get to bed and wake up at the same time every day. - Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the late afternoon and evening. Even though alcohol can make you feel sleepy, drinking any close to bedtime can disturb your sleep. - Time your exercise. Regular daytime exercise can help improve your nighttime sleep. However, exercise within 3 hours of bedtime can keep you awake. - Avoid daytime naps. Sleeping in the afternoon can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you feel like you cannot get by without a nap, set an alarm for 1 hour. When it goes off, get up and start moving. - Reserve your bed for sleeping. Watching TV, reading, or using a laptop or phone in bed can keep you awake. - Keep your bedroom comfortable. Try to keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. - Avoid drinking liquids and eating spicy meals before bed. Heartburn and late-night trips to the bathroom can interfere with your sleep. - Wind down before bed. Avoid working right up to bedtime. Try some relaxing activities that get you ready for sleep, such as listening to soft music or taking a warm bath. Exercising Although pain and fatigue may make exercise and daily activities difficult, it is important for you to be as physically active as possible. Research shows that regular exercise is one of the most useful treatments for fibromyalgia. If you have too much pain or fatigue to do exercise, you should begin with walking or other gentle exercise. Over time you can build your strength. Adjusting Your Work Life You can continue to work when you have fibromyalgia, but may have to make some changes to do so. For example, you may need to cut down the number of hours they work, switch to a less demanding job, or adapt your current job. An occupational therapist can help you make changes at work. For example, they can help design a more comfortable workstation or find more efficient and less painful ways to lift. Eating well Although some people with fibromyalgia report feeling better when they eat or avoid certain foods, no specific diet has been proven to influence fibromyalgia. Of course, it is important to have a healthy, balanced diet. Not only will proper nutrition give you more energy and make you generally feel better, it will also help you avoid other health problems.

The burning sensation can be severe, as if you scalded your mouth. Burning mouth syndrome can appear suddenly or develop gradually over time. Unfortunately, the cause often can't be determined. Although that makes treatment more challenging, you can often get burning mouth syndrome under better control by working closely with your health care team. Burning mouth syndrome care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms of burning mouth syndrome may include: - A burning or scalded sensation that most commonly affects your tongue, but may also affect your lips, gums, palate, throat or whole mouth - A sensation of dry mouth with increased thirst - Taste changes, such as a bitter or metallic taste - Loss of taste The discomfort from burning mouth syndrome typically has several different patterns. It may: - Occur every day, with little discomfort when you wake, but become worse as the day progresses - Start as soon as you wake up and last all day - Come and go Whatever pattern of mouth discomfort you have, burning mouth syndrome may last for months to years. In rare cases, symptoms may suddenly go away on their own or become less frequent. Some sensations may be temporarily relieved during eating or drinking. Burning mouth syndrome usually doesn't cause any noticeable physical changes to your tongue or mouth. When to see a doctor If you have discomfort, burning or soreness of your tongue, lips, gums or other areas of your mouth, see your doctor or dentist. They may need to work together to help pinpoint a cause and develop an effective treatment plan. The cause of burning mouth syndrome can be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary burning mouth syndrome When no clinical or lab abnormalities can be identified, the condition is called primary or idiopathic burning mouth syndrome. Some research suggests that primary burning mouth syndrome is related to problems with taste and sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system. Secondary burning mouth syndrome Sometimes burning mouth syndrome is caused by an underlying medical condition. In these cases, it's called secondary burning mouth syndrome. Underlying problems that may be linked to secondary burning mouth syndrome include: - Dry mouth (xerostomia), which can be caused by various medications, health problems, problems with salivary gland function or the side effects of cancer treatment - Other oral conditions, such as a fungal infection of the mouth (oral thrush), an inflammatory condition called oral lichen planus or a condition called geographic tongue that gives the tongue a map-like appearance - Nutritional deficiencies, such as a lack of iron, zinc, folate (vitamin B-9), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin (vitamin B-2), pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) and cobalamin (vitamin B-12) - Dentures, especially if they don't fit well, which can place stress on some muscles and tissues of your mouth, or if they contain materials that irritate mouth tissues - Allergies or reactions to foods, food flavorings, other food additives, fragrances, dyes or dental-work substances - Reflux of stomach acid (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) that enters your mouth from your stomach - Certain medications, particularly high blood pressure medications - Oral habits, such as tongue thrusting, biting the tip of the tongue and teeth grinding (bruxism) - Endocrine disorders, such as diabetes or underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) - Excessive mouth irritation, which may result from overbrushing your tongue, using abrasive toothpastes, overusing mouthwashes or having too many acidic drinks - Psychological factors, such as anxiety, depression or stress Burning mouth syndrome is uncommon. However, your risk may be greater if: - You're a woman - You're postmenopausal - You're over the age of 50 Burning mouth syndrome usually begins spontaneously, with no known triggering factor. However, certain factors may increase your risk of developing burning mouth syndrome, including: - Recent illness - Previous dental procedures - Wearing dentures - Allergic reactions to food - Medications - Traumatic life events - Stress - Anxiety - Depression Complications that burning mouth syndrome may cause or be associated with are mainly related to discomfort. They include, for example: - Difficulty falling asleep - Difficulty eating - Depression - Anxiety There's no one test that can determine if you have burning mouth syndrome. Instead, your doctor or dentist will try to rule out other problems before diagnosing burning mouth syndrome. Your doctor or dentist will review your medical history and medications, examine your mouth, and ask you to describe your symptoms, oral habits and oral care routine. In addition, your doctor will likely perform a general medical exam, looking for signs of other conditions. You may have some of the following tests: - Blood tests. Blood tests can check your complete blood count, glucose level, thyroid function, nutritional factors and immune functioning, all of which may provide clues about the source of your mouth discomfort. - Oral cultures or biopsies. Taking and analyzing samples from your mouth can determine whether you have a fungal, bacterial or viral infection. - Allergy tests. Your doctor may suggest allergy testing to see if you may be allergic to certain foods, additives or even substances in dentures. - Salivary measurements. With burning mouth syndrome, you may feel that you have a dry mouth. Salivary tests can confirm whether you have a reduced salivary flow. - Gastric reflux tests. These tests can determine if you have GERD. - Imaging. Your doctor may recommend an MRI, CT scan or other imaging tests to check for other health problems. - Temporarily stopping medication. If you take medications that may contribute to mouth discomfort, your doctor may suggest temporarily stopping them, if possible, to see if your discomfort goes away. Don't try this on your own, because it can be dangerous to stop some medications. - Psychological questionnaires. You may be asked to fill out questionnaires that can help determine if you have symptoms of depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions. For secondary burning mouth syndrome, treatment depends on any underlying conditions that may be causing your mouth discomfort. For example, replacing poorly fitting dentures or taking supplements for a vitamin deficiency may relieve your discomfort. That's why it's important to try to pinpoint the cause. Once any underlying causes are treated, your burning mouth syndrome symptoms should get better. There's no known cure for primary burning mouth syndrome and no one sure way to treat it. Solid research on the most effective methods is lacking. Treatment depends on your particular symptoms and is aimed at controlling them. You may need to try several treatment methods before finding one or a combination that helps reduce your mouth discomfort. Treatment options may include: - Saliva replacement products - Specific oral rinses or lidocaine - Capsaicin, a pain reliever that comes from chili peppers - An anticonvulsant medication called clonazepam (Klonopin) - Certain antidepressants - Medications that block nerve pain - Cognitive behavioral therapy In addition to medical treatment and prescription medications, these self-help measures may reduce your symptoms and your mouth discomfort: - Drink plenty of fluids to help ease the feeling of dry mouth, or suck on ice chips - Avoid acidic foods and liquids, such as tomatoes, orange juice, carbonated beverages and coffee - Avoid alcohol and products with alcohol, as they may irritate the lining of your mouth - Don't use tobacco products - Avoid spicy-hot foods - Avoid products with cinnamon or mint - Try different mild or flavor-free brands of toothpaste, such as one for sensitive teeth or one without mint or cinnamon - Take steps to reduce stress",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/burning-mouth-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350911
16,17,estradiol 75g patch. Can I stop using the patch only been on it 4.5 months,"Estradiol Transdermal Patch: Estradiol increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]). The longer you use estradiol, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you should be given another medication called a progestin to take with transdermal estradiol. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer. Before you begin using transdermal estradiol, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer and if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. Call your doctor immediately if you have abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding during your treatment with transdermal estradiol. Your doctor will watch you closely to help ensure you do not develop endometrial cancer during or after your treatment. In a large study, women who took estrogens (a group of medications that includes estradiol) by mouth with progestins had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand). Women who use transdermal estradiol alone or with progestins may also have a higher risk of developing these conditions. Tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke in the past year, and if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus ( a condition in which the body attacks its own tissues causing damage and swelling), breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer). The following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are using transdermal estradiol: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; double vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things; breast lumps or other breast changes; discharge from nipples; or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg. You can take steps to decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while you are using transdermal estradiol. Do not use transdermal estradiol alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Use the lowest dose of transdermal estradiol that controls your symptoms and only use transdermal estradiol as long as needed. Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should use a lower dose of transdermal estradiol or should stop using the medication. You should examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and a breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible. Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history. Tell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bedrest. Your doctor may tell you to stop using transdermal estradiol 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bedrest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots. Talk to your doctor regularly about the risks and benefits of using transdermal estradiol. Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are used to treat hot flushes (hot flashes; sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) and/or vaginal dryness, itching, and burning in women who are experiencing menopause (change of life; the end of monthly menstrual periods). Transdermal estradiol is also used to prevent osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause. Women who need to use transdermal estradiol for more than one of these reasons can benefit most from the medication. Women whose only bothersome symptoms are vaginal dryness, itching, or burning may benefit more from an estrogen product that is applied topically to the vagina. Women who only need a medication to prevent osteoporosis may benefit more from a different medication that does not contain estrogen. Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are also sometimes used as a source of estrogen in young women who do not produce enough estrogen naturally. Estradiol is in a class of medications called estrogen hormones. It works by replacing estrogen that is normally produced by the body. Menostar® brand patches contain less estrogen than other brands of estradiol transdermal patches. Menostar® patches are used only to prevent osteoporosis in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause. Transdermal estradiol comes as a patch to apply to the skin. Transdermal estradiol is usually applied once or twice a week, depending on the brand of patch that is used. Some women wear a patch all the time, and other women wear a patch according to a rotating schedule that alternates 3 weeks when the patch is worn followed by 1 week when the patch is not worn. Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week. There may be a calendar on the inner flap of your medication carton where you can keep track of your patch change schedule. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will start you on a low dose of transdermal estradiol and may increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome. If you are already taking or using an estrogen medication, your doctor will tell you how to switch from the estrogen medication you are taking or using to transdermal estradiol. Be sure you understand these instructions. Talk to your doctor about how well transdermal estradiol works for you. You should apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline. Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks or the hips. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that comes with your patches to find the best place(s) to apply the brand of patches you have received. Do not apply any brand of estradiol patches to the breasts or to skin that is oily, damaged, cut, or irritated. Do not apply estradiol patches to the waistline where they may be rubbed off by tight clothing or to the lower buttocks where they may be rubbed off by sitting. Be sure that the skin in the area where you plan to apply an estradiol patch is free of lotion, powders, or creams. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch to that spot. Some brands of patches should not be applied to an area of the skin that is exposed to sunlight. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out whether your patch should be applied to an area that will not be exposed to sunlight. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that came with your medication to find out if you need to be careful when you swim, bathe, shower, or use a sauna while wearing an estradiol transdermal patch. Some brands of patches are not likely to be affected by these activities, but some brands of patches may loosen. Some types of patches may also be pulled and loosened by your clothes or towel when you change clothes or dry your body. You may need to check that your patch is still firmly attached after these activities. If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. Be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers while you are doing this. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, fold it in half so it sticks to itself, dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children and pets, and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day. Each brand of estradiol transdermal patches should be applied following the specific directions given in the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully before you start using estradiol transdermal and each time you refill your prescription. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. The following general directions can help you remember some important things to do when you apply any type of estradiol transdermal patch. - Tear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch. - Remove the patch from the pouch. There may be a silver foil sticker used to protect the patch from moisture inside the pouch. Do not remove this sticker from the pouch. - Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch. Some patches have a liner that is made to peel off in two pieces. If your patch has that type of liner, you should peel off one part of the liner and press that side of the patch against your skin. Then fold back the patch, peel off the other part of the liner and press the second side of the patch against your skin. Always be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers. - Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges. - Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it. When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin. Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and dispose of it safely, so that is out of reach of children and pets. - Some brands of patches may leave a sticky substance on your skin. In some cases, this can be rubbed off easily. In other cases, you should wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion. Read the information that came with your patches to find out what to do if a substance is left on your skin after you remove your patch. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before using transdermal estradiol, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to any brand of transdermal estradiol, any other estrogen products, any other medications, or any adhesives. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if a medication you are allergic to contains estrogen. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone); antifungals such as itraconazole (Sporanox) and ketoconazole (Nizoral); aprepitant (Emend); carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol); cimetidine (Tagamet); clarithromycin (Biaxin); cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune); dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexpak); diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac, others); erythromycin (E.E.S, Erythrocin); fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem); fluvoxamine (Luvox); griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Grifulvin, Gris-PEG); lovastatin (Altocor, Mevacor); medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) such as atazanavir (Reyataz), delaviridine (Rescriptor); efavirenz (Sustiva);indinavir (Crixivan), lopinavir (in Kaletra),nelfinavir (Viracept), nevirapine (Viramune); ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), and saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase); medications for thyroid disease; nefazodone; other medications that contain estrogen; phenobarbital; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); rifabutin (Mycobutin); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate); sertraline (Zoloft);troleandomycin (TAO); verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan); and zafirlukast (Accolate). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. - tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma; seizures; migraine headaches; endometriosis (a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus [womb] grows in other areas of the body); uterine fibroids (growths in the uterus that are not cancer); yellowing of the skin or eyes, especially during pregnancy or while you were using an estrogen product; very high or very low levels of calcium in your blood; porphyria (condition in which abnormal substances build up in the blood and cause problems with the skin or nervous system)or gallbladder, thyroid, pancreas, liver or kidney disease. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using transdermal estradiol, call your doctor. - if you are using transdermal estradiol to prevent osteoporosis, talk to your doctor about additional ways to prevent the disease such as exercising and taking vitamin D and/or calcium supplements. Talk to your doctor about eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice while using this medication. Talk to your doctor about ways to increase the amount of calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Apply the missed patch as soon as you remember. Then apply the next patch according to your regular schedule. Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed patch. Transdermal estradiol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - headache - breast pain or tenderness - nausea - vomiting - constipation - gas - heartburn - weight gain or loss - hair loss - redness or irritation of the skin that was covered by the estradiol patch - swelling, redness, burning, irritation or itching of the vagina - vaginal discharge - painful menstrual periods - anxiety - depression - changes in mood - change in sexual desire - back, neck, or muscle pain - runny nose or congestion - cough - darkening of skin on face (may not go away even after you stop using transdermal estradiol) - unwanted hair growth - difficulty wearing contact lenses Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms or those listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately: - bulging eyes - yellowing of the skin or eyes - loss of appetite - fever - joint pain - stomach tenderness, pain, or swelling - movements that are difficult to control - itching - hives - rash, blisters on skin, or other skin changes - swelling, of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs - hoarseness - difficulty breathing or swallowing Transdermal estradiol may increase your risk of developing cancer of the ovaries and gallbladder disease that may need to be treated with surgery. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using transdermal estradiol. Transdermal estradiol may cause growth to slow or stop early in children who use large doses for a long time. Your child's doctor will monitor her carefully during her treatment with transdermal estradiol. Talk to your child's doctor about the risks of giving this medication to your child. Transdermal estradiol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). Keep estradiol patches sealed in their original pouches and out of reach of children. Store the patches at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Symptoms of overdose may include: - nausea - vomiting - vaginal bleeding Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your body's response to transdermal estradiol. Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are using transdermal estradiol. Do not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital.

17,18,"Ear Wax.. I sometimes drop Peroxide into the ear and let it bubble for a couple of minutes, then use warm water to flush it out. is there harm?","Ear wax: The ear canal is lined with hair follicles. The ear canal also has glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing. Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. Ear wax protects the ear by: - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and small objects from entering and damaging the ear - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeper and block the ear canal. Some of the common symptoms are: - Earache - Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged - Noises in the ear (tinnitus) - Partial hearing loss, may get worse Most cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home. The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear: - Baby oil - Commercial drops - Glycerin - Mineral oil - Water Another method is to wash out the wax. - Use body-temperature water (cooler or warmer water may cause brief but severe dizziness or vertigo). - Hold your head upright and straighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward. - Use a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug. - Tip your head to allow the water to drain. You may need to repeat irrigation several times. To avoid damaging your ear or causing an infection: - Never irrigate the ear if the eardrum may have a hole in it. - Do not irrigate the ear with a jet irrigator designed for cleaning teeth (such as a WaterPik). After the wax is removed, dry the ear thoroughly. You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear. You may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying. Do not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears. Never try to clean the ear by putting any object, such as a cotton swab, into the ear canal. If you cannot remove the wax plug or you have discomfort, consult a health care provider, who may remove the wax by: - Repeating the irrigation attempts - Suctioning the ear canal - Using a small device called a curette - Using a microscope to help The ear may become blocked with wax again in the future. Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed. Rarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal. This can also damage the eardrum. See your provider if your ears are blocked with wax and you are unable to remove the wax. Also call if you have an ear wax blockage and you develop new symptoms, such as: - Drainage from the ear - Ear pain - Fever - Hearing loss that continues after you clean the wax Updated by: Linda J.

It lists the services you received (such as procedures and tests), as well as medicines and supplies. Most of time, you will get a separate bill for health care provider fees. It is a good idea to ask for a more detailed hospital bill with all of the charges described separately. That can help you make sure the bill is correct. If you have insurance, you may also get a form from your insurance company, called an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This is not a bill. It explains: - What is covered by your insurance - Amount of payment made and to whom - Deductibles or co-insurance A deductible is the amount of money you must pay each year to cover your medical care expenses before your insurance policy starts to pay. Co-insurance is the amount you pay for medical care after you have met your health insurance deductible. It is often given as a percentage. The information on the EOB should match your hospital bill.

20,21,Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.. Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. I would like to request further knowledge on this specific disorder.,"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a growth disorder that causes large body size, large organs, and other symptoms. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present at birth. The signs and symptoms of the disorder vary somewhat from child to child. Infancy can be a critical period in babies with this condition because of the possibility of: - Low blood sugar - A type of hernia called an omphalocele (when present) - An enlarged tongue (macroglossia) - An increased rate of tumor growth. Wilms tumors and hepatoblastomas are the most common tumors in children with this syndrome. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is caused by a defect in the genes on chromosome 11. About 10% of cases can be passed down through families. Signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome include: - Large size for a newborn - Red birth mark on forehead or eyelids (Nevus flammeus) - Creases in ear lobes - Large tongue (macroglossia) - Low blood sugar - Abdominal wall defect (umbilical hernia or omphalocele) - Enlargement of some organs - Overgrowth of one side of the body (hemihyperplasia/hemihypertrophy) - Tumor growth, such as Wilms tumors and hepatoblastomas The health care provider will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Often this is enough to make a diagnosis. Tests for the disorder include: - Blood tests for low blood sugar - Chromosomal studies for abnormalities in chromosome 11 - Ultrasound of the abdomen Infants with low blood sugar may be treated with fluids given through a vein (intravenous, IV). Some infants may need medicine or other management if low blood sugar continues. Defects in the abdominal wall may need to be repaired. If the enlarged tongue makes it hard to breath or eat, surgery may be needed, Children with overgrowth on one side of the body should be watched for a curved spine (scoliosis). The child also must be watched closely for the development of tumors. Tumor screening includes blood tests and abdominal ultrasounds. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome typically lead normal lives. Further study is needed to develop long-term follow-up information. These complications can occur: - Development of tumors - Feeding problems due to enlarged tongue - Breathing problems due to enlarged tongue - Scoliosis due to hemihypertrophy If you have a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and worrisome symptoms develop, call your pediatrician right away. There is no known prevention for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Genetic counseling may be of value for families who would like to have more children. Updated by: Jennifer M.

Is there a better drug if so what.,"Mastocytosis (Treatment): The treatment for mastocytosis depends on the particular symptoms of each person. Treatment for symptoms that affect the skin include  antihistamines and  oral psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) therapy. If the symptoms are not responsive to other treatment, a doctor may prescribe  steroid creams, ointments, or solutions to be applied to the skin ( topical  corticosteroids  treatment). [1]  Proton pump inhibitors can be used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms and bone pain. Different treatments work better for some people than others. [1] Many specialists recommended that people with mastocytosis have  injectable epinephrine that they can use in case of  anaphylactic shock. Other recommendations include trying to avoid known triggers of symptoms of mastocytosis.

Hello, I would like to know if taking Dicyclomine 20mg, phentermine can have a adverse effect?","Phentermine: Phentermine is used for a limited period of time to speed weight loss in overweight people who are exercising and eating a low-calorie diet. Phentermine is in a class of medications called anorectics. It works by decreasing appetite. Phentermine comes as tablets and extended-release capsules. It usually is taken as a single daily dose in the morning or three times a day 30 minutes before meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take phentermine exactly as directed. Most people takephentermine for 3 to 6 weeks; the length of treatment depends on how you respond to the medication. Phentermine can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period than your doctor tells you to. If you are taking the extended-release (long-acting) tablets, do not split, chew, or crush them tablet. There are some tablets that can be crushed and mixed with food. This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking phentermine, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to phentermine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in phentermine tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), guanethidine, insulin medications for weight loss and depression, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). Also tell your doctor if you are taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar) and tranylcypromine (Parnate), or if you have stopped taking one of these medications in the past 2 weeks. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart disease, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries), hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland), diabetes, glaucoma, or a history of drug abuse. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking phentermine, call your doctor. - talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking phentermine if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take phentermine because it is not as safe as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition. - you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you. - ask your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are taking phentermine. Alcohol can make the side effects of phentermine worse. - if you have diabetes, you may need to decrease your dose of insulin while taking phentermine. Call your doctor if you have questions or problems. Follow the diet and exercise program your doctor has given you. Phentermine works best in combination with a diet program. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Phentermine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - dry mouth - unpleasant taste - diarrhea - constipation - vomiting Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: - increased blood pressure - heart palpitations - restlessness - dizziness - tremor - insomnia - shortness of breath - chest pain - swelling of the legs and ankles - difficulty doing exercise that you have been able to do Phentermine may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems during your treatment with phentermine. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet.

26,27,Dementia. Is dementia genetically passed down or could anyone get it,"Dementia - home care (Information): A loved one with dementia will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. You can help by trying to understand how the person with dementia perceives his or her world. Give the person a chance to talk about any challenges and take part in his or her own daily care. Start by talking with your loved one's health care provider. Ask how you can: - Help the person stay calm and oriented - Make dressing and grooming easier - Talk to the person - Help with memory loss - Manage behavior and sleep problems Tips for reducing confusion in people with dementia include: - Have familiar objects and people around. - Keep lights on at night. - Use reminders, notes, lists of routine tasks, or directions for daily activities. - Stick to a simple activity schedule. Taking regular walks with a caregiver can help improve communication skills and prevent wandering. Calming music may reduce wandering and restlessness, ease anxiety, and improve sleep and behavior. People with dementia should have their eyes and ears checked. If problems are found, hearing aids, glasses, or cataract surgery may be needed. People with dementia should also have regular driving tests. At some point, it won't be safe for them to continue to drive. This may not be an easy conversation, so seek help from their provider and other family members. State laws vary on the ability of a person with dementia to continue to drive. Supervised meals can help with feeding. People with dementia often forget to eat and drink, and can become dehydrated as a result. Talk to the provider about the need for extra calories due to increased physical activity from restlessness and wandering. Also talk to the provider about: - Watching for risk of choking and what to do if choking occurs - How to increase safety in the home - How to prevent falls - Ways to improve bathroom safety The Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return Program requires people with dementia to wear an identification bracelet. If they wander, their caregiver can contact the police and the national Safe Return office, where information about them is stored and shared nationwide. Eventually, people with dementia may need 24-hour monitoring and assistance to provide a safe environment, control aggressive or agitated behavior, and meet their needs. LONG-TERM CARE A person with dementia may need monitoring and help at home or in an institution. Possible options include: - Adult day care - Boarding homes - Nursing homes - In-home care Many organizations are available to help you care for a person with dementia. They include: - Adult protective services - Community resources - Local or state government departments of aging - Visiting nurses or aides - Volunteer services In some communities, dementia-related support groups may be available. Family counseling can help family members cope with home care. Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions may make it easier to decide on care for the person with dementia. Seek legal advice early, before the person is unable to make these decisions. There are support groups that can provide information and resources for people with Alzheimer disease and their caregivers.",https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007428.htm
27,28,"sleep apnea. Is there a ""sleep apnea surgery"". I've heard that there is , but have never found a doctor that does this. My husband has been on C-pap for two years but has not been able to keep it on for more then 2 hours. He is not overweight, has had a stroke at 40 years old and double by-pass at 50 years old. Otherwise he follows doctors orders and has no other problems. Thank you for your time,","Sleep apnea (Treatment): For milder cases of sleep apnea, your doctor may recommend only lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or quitting smoking. And if you have nasal allergies, your doctor will recommend treatment for your allergies. If these measures don't improve your signs and symptoms or if your apnea is moderate to severe, a number of other treatments are available. Certain devices can help open up a blocked airway. In other cases, surgery may be necessary. Treatments for obstructive sleep apnea may include: Therapies - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). If you have moderate to severe sleep apnea, you may benefit from a machine that delivers air pressure through a mask placed over your nose while you sleep. With CPAP (SEE-pap), the air pressure is somewhat greater than that of the surrounding air, and is just enough to keep your upper airway passages open, preventing apnea and snoring. Although CPAP is the most common and reliable method of treating sleep apnea, some people find it cumbersome or uncomfortable. Some people give up on CPAP, but with some practice, most people learn to adjust the tension of the straps to obtain a comfortable and secure fit. You may need to try more than one type of mask to find one that's comfortable. Some people benefit from also using a humidifier along with their CPAP systems. Don't just stop using the CPAP machine if you experience problems. Check with your doctor to see what modifications can be made to make you more comfortable. Additionally, contact your doctor if you are still snoring despite treatment or begin snoring again. If your weight changes, the pressure settings of the CPAP machine may need to be adjusted. - Other airway pressure devices. If CPAP continues to be a problem for you, you may be able to use a different type of airway pressure device that automatically adjusts the pressure while you're sleeping (Auto-CPAP). Units that supply bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) are also available. These provide more pressure when you inhale and less when you exhale. - Expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). These small, single-use devices are placed over each nostril before you go to sleep. The device is a valve that allows air to move freely in, but when you exhale, air must go through small holes in the valve. This increases pressure in the airway and keeps it open. The device may help reduce snoring and daytime sleepiness in people with mild obstructive sleep apnea. And it may be an option for some who can't tolerate CPAP. - Oral appliances. Another option is wearing an oral appliance designed to keep your throat open. CPAP is more reliably effective than oral appliances, but oral appliances may be easier to use. Some are designed to open your throat by bringing your jaw forward, which can sometimes relieve snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea. A number of devices are available from your dentist. You may need to try different devices before finding one that works for you. Once you find the right fit, you'll still need to follow up with your dentist repeatedly during the first year and then regularly after that to ensure that the fit is still good and to reassess your signs and symptoms. Surgery Surgery is usually only an option after other treatments have failed. Generally, at least a three-month trial of other treatment options is suggested before considering surgery. However, for those few people with certain jaw structure problems, it's a good first option. The goal of surgery for sleep apnea is to enlarge the airway through your nose or throat that may be vibrating and causing you to snore or that may be blocking your upper air passages and causing sleep apnea. Surgical options may include: - Tissue removal. During this procedure, which is called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, your doctor removes tissue from the rear of your mouth and top of your throat. Your tonsils and adenoids usually are removed as well. This type of surgery may be successful in stopping throat structures from vibrating and causing snoring. It's less effective than CPAP, and isn't considered a reliable treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Removing tissues in the back of your throat with radiofrequency energy (radiofrequency ablation) may be an option for people who can't tolerate CPAP or oral appliances. - Jaw repositioning. In this procedure, your jaw is moved forward from the remainder of your face bones. This enlarges the space behind the tongue and soft palate, making obstruction less likely. This procedure is known as maxillomandibular advancement. - Implants. Plastic rods are surgically implanted into the soft palate after you've received local anesthetic. - Creating a new air passageway (tracheostomy). You may need this form of surgery if other treatments have failed and you have severe, life-threatening sleep apnea. In this procedure, your surgeon makes an opening in your neck and inserts a metal or plastic tube through which you breathe. You keep the opening covered during the day. But at night you uncover it to allow air to pass in and out of your lungs, bypassing the blocked air passage in your throat. Other types of surgery may help reduce snoring and contribute to the treatment of sleep apnea by clearing or enlarging air passages: - Nasal surgery to remove polyps or straighten a crooked partition between your nostrils (deviated nasal septum) - Surgery to remove enlarged tonsils or adenoids - Weight-loss surgery Treatments for central and complex sleep apnea may include: Therapies - Treatment for associated medical problems. Possible causes of central sleep apnea include heart or neuromuscular disorders, and treating those conditions may help. For example, optimizing therapy for heart failure may eliminate central sleep apnea. - Supplemental oxygen. Using supplemental oxygen while you sleep may help if you have central sleep apnea. Various forms of oxygen are available as well as different devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs. - Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV). This more recently approved airflow device learns your normal breathing pattern and stores the information in a built-in computer. After you fall asleep, the machine uses pressure to normalize your breathing pattern and prevent pauses in your breathing. ASV appears to be more successful than other forms of positive airway pressure at treating complex sleep apnea in some people. - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This method, also used in obstructive sleep apnea, involves wearing a pressurized mask over your nose while you sleep. CPAP may eliminate snoring and prevent sleep apnea. As with obstructive sleep apnea, it's important that you use the device as directed. If your mask is uncomfortable or the pressure feels too strong, talk with your doctor so that adjustments can be made. - Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Unlike CPAP, which supplies steady, constant pressure to your upper airway as you breathe in and out, BiPAP builds to a higher pressure when you inhale and decreases to a lower pressure when you exhale. The goal of this treatment is to assist the weak breathing pattern of central sleep apnea. Some BiPAP devices can be set to automatically deliver a breath if the device detects you haven't taken one after so many seconds. Along with these treatments, you may read, hear or see TV ads about different treatments for sleep apnea. Talk with your doctor about any treatment before you try it to find out how useful it might be.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631

But then the stool is really soft and there were a few times I almost didn't make to the bathroom. Is there a way for a happy medium,"Diarrhea (Symptoms and Causes): Acute and persistent diarrhea may have causes that are different from those of chronic diarrhea. In many cases, doctors do not find the cause of diarrhea. Most diarrhea goes away on its own within 4 days, and finding the cause is not necessary.The most common causes of acute and persistent diarrhea are infections, travelers’ diarrhea, and side effects of medicines.InfectionsThree types of infections that cause diarrhea includeViral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including norovirus and rotavirus. Viral gastroenteritis is a common cause of acute diarrhea. Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria can enter your body through contaminated food or water and cause diarrhea. Common bacteria that cause diarrhea include Campylobacter, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, and Shigella. Parasitic infections. Parasites can enter your body through food or water and settle in your digestive tract. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Cryptosporidium enteritis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia.Infections in the digestive tract that spread through foods or drinks are called foodborne illnesses.Infections lasting more than 2 weeks and less than 4 weeks can cause persistent diarrhea.Travelers’ diarrheaTravelers’ diarrhea is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Travelers’ diarrhea is most often acute. However, some parasites cause diarrhea that lasts longer. Travelers’ diarrhea can be a problem for people traveling to developing countries.Side effects of medicinesMany medicines may cause diarrhea. Medicines that may cause diarrhea include antibiotics, antacids containing magnesium, and medicines used to treat cancer.Some infections, food allergies and intolerances, digestive tract problems, abdominal surgery, and long-term use of medicines can cause chronic diarrhea.InfectionsSome infections from bacteria and parasites that cause diarrhea do not go away quickly without treatment. Also, after an infection, people may have problems digesting carbohydrates such as lactose or proteins in foods such as cow’s milk, milk products, or soy. Problems digesting carbohydrates or proteins can prolong diarrhea.Food allergies and intolerancesAllergies to foods such as cow’s milk, soy, cereal grains, eggs, and seafood may cause chronic diarrhea.Lactose intolerance is a common condition that may cause diarrhea after eating foods or drinking liquids that contain milk or milk products.Fructose intolerance is a condition that may cause diarrhea after eating foods or drinking liquids that contain fructose, a sugar found in fruits, fruit juices, and honey. Fructose is added to many foods and soft drinks as a sweetener called high-fructose corn syrup.Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol may cause diarrhea in some people. Sugar-free candies and gum often include these sugar alcohols.Digestive tract problemsDigestive tract problems that may cause chronic diarrhea includeceliac disease Crohn’s disease irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ulcerative colitisAbdominal surgeryYou may develop chronic diarrhea after abdominal surgery. Abdominal surgery is an operation on the appendix, gallbladder, large intestine, liver, pancreas, small intestine, spleen, or stomach.Long-term use of medicinesMedicines that must be taken for a long time may cause chronic diarrhea. Some medicines, such as antibiotics, can change the normal gut flora and increase your chances of infection with Clostridium difficile, a bacterium that can cause chronic diarrhea.",https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/diarrhea
29,30,"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Uveitis: Uveitis is a form of eye inflammation. It affects the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea). Uveitis (u-vee-I-tis) warning signs often come on suddenly and get worse quickly. They include eye redness, pain and blurred vision. The condition can affect one or both eyes. It primarily affects people ages 20 to 50, but it may also affect children. Possible causes of uveitis are infection, injury, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Many times a cause can't be identified. Uveitis can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent the complications of uveitis. The signs, symptoms and characteristics of uveitis include: - Eye redness - Eye pain - Light sensitivity - Blurred vision - Dark, floating spots in your field of vision (floaters) - Decreased vision Symptoms may occur suddenly and get worse quickly, though in some cases, they develop gradually. They may affect one or both eyes. The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye. It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. The choroid is sandwiched between the retina and the sclera. The retina is located at the inside wall of the eye and the sclera is the outer white part of the eye wall. The uvea provides blood flow to the deep layers of the retina. The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed: - Iritis (anterior uveitis) affects the front of your eye and is the most common type. - Cyclitis (intermediate uveitis) affects the ciliary body. - Choroiditis and retinitis (posterior uveitis) affect the back of your eye. - Diffuse uveitis (panuveitis) occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed. In any of these conditions, the jelly-like material in the center of your eye (vitreous) can become inflamed and infiltrated with inflammatory cells. When to seek medical advice Contact your doctor if you think you have the warning signs of uveitis. He or she may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). If you're having significant eye pain and unexpected vision problems, seek immediate medical attention. In about half of all cases, the specific cause of uveitis isn't clear. If a cause can be determined, it may be one of the following: - Eye injury or surgery - An autoimmune disorder, such as sarcoidosis or ankylosing spondylitis - An inflammatory disorder, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis - An infection, such as cat-scratch disease, herpes zoster, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, Lyme disease or West Nile virus - A cancer that affects the eye, such as lymphoma People with changes in certain genes may be more likely to develop uveitis. In addition, a recent study shows a significant association between uveitis and cigarette smoking. When you visit an eye specialist (ophthalmologist), he or she will likely conduct a complete eye exam and gather a thorough health history. You may also need these tests: - Blood tests - Analysis of fluid from the eye - Photography to evaluate the retinal blood flow (angiography) - Photography to measure the thickness of the retinal tissue and to determine the presence or absence of fluid in or under the retina. If the ophthalmologist thinks an underlying condition may be the cause of your uveitis, you may be referred to another doctor for a general medical examination and laboratory tests. Sometimes, it's difficult to find a specific cause for uveitis. However, your doctor will try to determine whether your uveitis is caused by an infection or another condition. If uveitis is caused by an underlying condition, treatment will focus on that specific condition. The goal of treatment is to reduce the inflammation in your eye. Several treatment options are available. Medications - Drugs that reduce inflammation. Your doctor may first prescribe eyedrops with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as a corticosteroid. If those don't help, a corticosteroid pill or injection may be the next step. - Drugs that fight bacteria or viruses. If uveitis is caused by an infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, antiviral medications or other medicines, with or without corticosteroids, to bring the infection under control. - Drugs that affect the immune system or destroy cells. You may need immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs if your uveitis affects both eyes, doesn't respond well to corticosteroids or becomes severe enough to threaten your vision. Some of these medications can have serious side effects, such as glaucoma and cataracts. You may need to visit your doctor for follow-up examinations and blood tests every 1 to 3 months. Surgical and other procedures - Vitrectomy. Surgery to remove some of the vitreous in your eye (vitrectomy) may be necessary to manage the condition. - Surgery that implants a device into the eye to provide a slow and sustained release of a medication. For people with difficult-to-treat posterior uveitis, a device that's implanted in the eye may be an option. This device slowly releases corticosteroid medication into the eye for two to three years. Possible side effects of this treatment include cataracts and glaucoma. The speed of your recovery depends in part on the type of uveitis you have and the severity of your symptoms. Uveitis that affects the back of your eye (choroiditis) tends to heal more slowly than uveitis in the front of the eye (iritis). Severe inflammation takes longer to clear up than mild inflammation does. Uveitis can come back. Make an appointment with your doctor if any of your symptoms reappear after successful treatment. Some alternative medicine treatments have anti-inflammatory properties, but they haven't been well-studied for the treatment of uveitis. Let your doctor know if you plan on using any alternative supplements or treatments, because some may interact with treatments you're receiving or cause adverse reactions.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uveitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378734

How much urine does an average human bladder hold - in ounces?,"HCG in urine: This type of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test measures the specific level of HCG in the urine. HCG is a hormone produced in the body during pregnancy. Other HCG tests include: - HCG in blood serum - qualitative - HCG in blood serum - quantitative - Pregnancy test To collect a urine sample, you urinate into a special (sterile) cup. Home pregnancy tests require the test strip to be dipped into the urine sample or passed through the urine stream while urinating. Carefully follow package directions. In most cases, a urine sample taken the first time you urinate in the morning is best. This is when urine is the most concentrated and has enough HCG to be detected. No special preparation is needed. The test involves urinating into a cup or onto a test strip. Urine HCG tests are a common method of determining if a woman is pregnant. The best time to test for pregnancy at home is after you miss your period. The test result will be reported as negative or positive. - The test is negative if you are not pregnant. - The test is positive if you are pregnant. A pregnancy test, including a properly performed home pregnancy test, is considered to be very accurate. Positive results are more likely to be accurate than negative results. When the test is negative but pregnancy is still suspected, the test should be repeated in 1 week. There are no risks, except for false positive or false negative results. Updated by: John D.

In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they reach certain height or weight requirements. These vary by state. Most children grow big enough to move to a regular seat belt between 8 and 12 years old. To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat. - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital. - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly. - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too. - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off. - Even after children are big enough to wear a seat belt, riding in the back seat is safest. When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time: - The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle. - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident. - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child. - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat. - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm. The types of child safety seats and restraints include: - Rear-facing seats - Forward-facing seats - Booster seats - Car beds - Built-in car seats - Travel vests REAR-FACING SEATS A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed in the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat. Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds (10 to 13.5 kilograms), depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Many children grow out of these seats by age 8 to 9 months. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving. Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 3 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat. FORWARD-FACING SEATS A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat. A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in. BOOSTER SEATS A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest. Use booster seats for older children until they are big enough to fit into a seat belt properly. The lap belt should fit low and tight across the upper thighs, and the shoulder belt should fit snug across the shoulder and chest and not cross the neck or face. A child's legs must be long enough so the feet can be flat on the floor. Most children can wear a seatbelt sometime between ages 8 and 12 years. CAR BEDS These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital. BUILT-IN SEATS Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer. TRAVEL VESTS Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest. Updated by: Neil K.

34,35,Swan NDC 0869-0871-43. I found 4 cases of expired (04/2010) Hydrogen Peroxide. How do I safely dispose of this product?,"How and when to get rid of unused medicines (How to Dispose of Expired Medicines Safely): Disposing medicines safely prevents others from using them accidentally or intentionally. It also prevents harmful residues from getting into the environment. Look for disposal instructions on the label or information booklet. DO NOT FLUSH UNUSED MEDICINES You should not flush most medicines or pour them down the drain. Medicines contain chemicals that may not break down in the environment. When flushed down the toilet or sink, these residues can pollute our water resources. This may affect fish and other marine life. These residues can also end up in our drinking water. However, some medicines must be disposed of as soon as possible to reduce their potential harm. You can flush them to prevent someone from using them. These include opioids or narcotics usually prescribed for pain. You should ONLY flush medicines when it specifically says to do so on the label. DRUG TAKE-BACK PROGRAMS The best way to dispose of your medicines is to bring them to drug take-back programs. These programs safely dispose of medicines by burning them up. Drug take-back programs are organized from time to time in most communities. Or, your town may have special days when you can bring hazardous household items such as unused medicines to a specific location for disposal. Contact your local trash and recycling service to find out when the next event is scheduled in your community. Medicines NOT accepted by most drug take-back programs include: - Liquid medicines - Needles - Sprays - Inhalers - Creams HOUSEHOLD DISPOSAL If you don't have a take-back program available, you can throw your medicines out with your household trash. To do so safely: - Take the medicine out of its container and mix it with other unpleasant garbage such as kitty litter or used coffee grounds. DO NOT crush pills or capsules. - Place the mixture into a sealable plastic bag or sealed contain that won't leak. - Be sure to remove your Rx number and all personal information from the medicine bottle. Scratch it off or cover it with a permanent marker or duct tape. - Throw the container and pill bottles out with the rest of your trash.",https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000943.htm
35,36,congenital diaphragmatic hernia.. congenital diaphragmatic hernia. what are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Can cousin marriage cause this? What kind of lung disease the baby might experience life long?,"congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

36,37,"shingles. need to know about the work place and someone having shingles, especially while handling food.","Shingles: Shingles (herpes zoster) is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox — the varicella-zoster virus. The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense.  Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze.  The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles.  Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system.  When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin.  The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles. The severity and duration of an attack of shingles can be significantly reduced by immediate treatment with antiviral drugs, which include acyclovir, valcyclovir, or famcyclovir. Antiviral drugs may also help stave off the painful after-effects of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia. Other treatments for postherpetic neuralgia include steroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants (including pregabalin and gabapentin enacarbil), and topical agents.  The varicella zoster virus vaccine (Zostavax) has been approved by the food and Drug Administration for adults age 50 and older.  Researchers found that giving older adults the vaccine reduced the expected number of later cases of shingles by half.  And in people who still got the disease despite immunization, the severity and complications of shingles were dramatically reduced. The shingles vaccine is a preventive therapy and not a treatment for those who already have shingles or long-lasting nerve pain (postherpetic neuralgia). For most healthy people who receive treatment soon after the outbreak of blisters, the lesions heal, the pain subsides within 3 to 5 weeks, and the blisters often leave no scars.  However, shingles is a serious threat in immunosuppressed individuals — for example, those with HIV infection or who are receiving cancer treatments that can weaken their immune systems.  People who receive organ transplants are also vulnerable to shingles because they are given drugs that suppress the immune system.   A person with a shingles rash can pass the virus to someone, usually a child, who has never had chickenpox, but the child will develop chickenpox, not shingles.  A person with chickenpox cannot give shingles to someone else.  Shingles comes from the virus hiding inside the person's body, not from an outside source.",https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Herpes-Zoster-Information-Page

38,39,side efectes to methadone. i jest started taking methadone and have confusion my face itches,"Methadone: [Posted 09/20/2017] AUDIENCE: Health Professional, Pain Management ISSUE: Based on additional review, FDA is advising that the opioid addiction medications buprenorphine and methadone should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS). The combined use of these drugs increases the risk of serious side effects; however, the harm caused by untreated opioid addiction usually outweighs these risks. Careful medication management by health care professionals can reduce these risks. FDA is requiring this information to be added to the buprenorphine and methadone drug labels along with detailed recommendations for minimizing the use of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) drugs and benzodiazepines together. BACKGROUND: Many patients with opioid dependence may also use benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, either under a health care professional's direction or illicitly. Although there are serious risks with combining these medicines, excluding patients from MAT or discharging patients from treatment because of use of benzodiazepines or CNS depressants is not likely to stop them from using these drugs together. Instead, the combined use may continue outside the treatment setting, which could result in more severe outcomes. RECOMMENDATIONS: Health care professionals should take several actions and precautions and develop a treatment plan when buprenorphine or methadone is used in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants. These include: - Educating patients about the serious risks of combined use, including overdose and death, that can occur with CNS depressants even when used as prescribed, as well as when used illicitly. - Developing strategies to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants when starting MAT. - Tapering the benzodiazepine or CNS depressant to discontinuation if possible. - Verifying the diagnosis if a patient is receiving prescribed benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for anxiety or insomnia, and considering other treatment options for these conditions. - Recognizing that patients may require MAT medications indefinitely and their use should continue for as long as patients are benefiting and their use contributes to the intended treatment goals. - Coordinating care to ensure other prescribers are aware of the patient's buprenorphine or methadone treatment. - Monitoring for illicit drug use, including urine or blood screening. Patients taking MAT drugs should continue to take these medicines as prescribed. Do not stop taking other prescribed medicines without first talking to your health care professional. Before starting any new medicines, tell your health care professional that you are taking MAT. Do not take non-prescribed benzodiazepines or other sedatives (See Table 2 in the Drug Safety Communication, available at: http://bit.ly/2fdAzZI, List of Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants) or use alcohol when taking MAT because the combined use increases the possibility of harm, including overdose and death. For more information visit the FDA website at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation and http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety. Methadone may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take methadone. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of lung diseases that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema), a head injury, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain. The risk that you will develop breathing problems may be higher if you are an older adult or are weak or malnourished due to disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath. Taking certain other medications during your treatment with methadone may increase the risk that you will experience serious, life-threatening side effects such as breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take any of the following medications: benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Diastat, Valium), estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam (Ativan), and triazolam (Halcion); other narcotic pain medications; medications for nausea or mental illness; muscle relaxants; sedatives; sleeping pills; or tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take methadone with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Drinking alcohol, taking prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with methadone increases the risk that you will experience serious, life-threatening side effects. Do not drink alcohol, take prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or use street drugs during your treatment. Methadone may be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time or in a different way than prescribed by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness. There is a greater risk that you will overuse methadone if you have or have ever had any of these conditions. Do not allow anyone else to take your medication. Methadone may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Store methadone in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Be especially careful to keep methadone out of the reach of children. Keep track of how many tablets or how much liquid is left so you will know if any medication is missing. Dispose of any unwanted methadone tablets or oral solution properly according to instructions. (See STORAGE and DISPOSAL.) Methadone may cause a prolonged QT interval (a rare heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death). Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had long QT syndrome; or if you have or ever had a slow or irregular heartbeat; low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, or heart disease. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking or plan to take any of the following medications: antidepressants such as amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Silenor), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil), and trimipramine (Surmontil); certain antifungals such as fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and voriconazole (Vfend); diuretics ('water pills'); erythromycin (Eryc, Erythrocin, others); fludrocortisone; certain laxatives; medications for irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone), disopyramide (Norpace), dofetilide (Tikosyn), flecainide, ibutilide (Corvert), procainamide, and quinidine (in Nuedexta); nicardipine (Cardene); risperidone (Risperdal); and sertraline (Zoloft). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: pounding heartbeat, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take methadone regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth. Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms: irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep, high-pitched cry, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, vomiting, diarrhea, or failure to gain weight. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking methadone for your condition. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with methadone and each time you fill your prescription if a Medication Guide is available for the methadone product you are taking. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Use of methadone to treat opiate addiction: If you have been addicted to an opiate (narcotic drug such as heroin), and you are taking methadone to help you stop taking or continue not taking the drug, you must enroll in a treatment program. The treatment program must be approved by the state and federal governments and must treat patients according to specific federal laws. You may have to take your medication at the treatment program facility under the supervision of the program staff. Ask your doctor or the treatment program staff if you have any questions about enrolling in the program or taking or getting your medication. Methadone is used to relieve severe pain in people who are expected to need pain medication around the clock for a long time and who cannot be treated with other medications. It also is used to prevent withdrawal symptoms in patients who were addicted to opiate drugs and are enrolled in treatment programs in order to stop taking or continue not taking the drugs. Methadone is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. Methadone works to treat pain by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. It works to treat people who were addicted to opiate drugs by producing similar effects and preventing withdrawal symptoms in people who have stopped using these drugs. Methadone comes as a tablet, a dispersible (can be dissolved in liquid) tablet , a solution (liquid), and a concentrated solution to take by mouth. When methadone is used to relieve pain, it may be taken every 8 to 12 hours. If you take methadone as part of a treatment program, your doctor will prescribe the dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methadone exactly as directed. If you are using the dispersible tablets, do not chew or swallow before mixing the tablet in a liquid. If your doctor has told you to take only part of a tablet, break the tablet carefully along the lines that have been scored into it. Place the tablet or piece of the tablet in at least 120 mL (4 ounces) of water, orange juice, Tang®, citrus flavors of Kool-Aid®, or a citrus fruit drink to dissolve. Drink the entire mixture right away. If some tablet residue remains in the cup after you drink the mixture, add a small amount of liquid to the cup and drink it all. Your doctor may change your dose of methadone during your treatment. Your doctor may decrease your dose or tell you to take methadone less often as your treatment continues. If you experience pain during your treatment, your doctor may increase your dose or may prescribe an additional medication to control your pain. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with methadone. Do not take extra doses of methadone or take doses of methadone earlier than they are scheduled even if you experience pain. Do not stop taking methadone without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking methadone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, muscle pain, widened pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes), irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, stomach cramps, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking methadone, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to methadone, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in the methadone product you plan to take. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention the medications listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section and any of the following: antihistamines; buprenorphine (Suboxone, in Zubsolv); butorphanol; carbamazepine (Cabatrol, Equetro, Tegretol, others); cyclobenzaprine (Amrix); dextromethorphan (found in many cough medications; in Nuedexta); fluvoxamine (Luvox); medications for glaucoma, irritable bowel disease, Parkinson's disease, ulcers, and urinary problems; certain medications for HIV including abacavir (Ziagen, in Trizivir), darunavir (Prezista), didanosine (Videx), efavirenz (Sustiva, in Atripla), lopinavir (in Kaletra), nelfinavir (Viracept), nevirapine (Viramune), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), saquinavir (Invirase), stavudine (Zerit), telaprevir (no longer available in the U.S.; Incivek), tipranavir (Aptivus), and zidovudine (Retrovir, in Combivir); lithium (Lithobid); medications for migraine headaches such as almotriptan (Axert), eletriptan (Relpax), frovatriptan (Frova), naratriptan (Amerge), rizatriptan (Maxalt), sumatriptan (Alsuma, Imitrex, in Treximet), and zolmitriptan (Zomig); mirtazapine (Remeron); nalbuphine; naloxone (Evzio, Narcan, in Zubsolv); naltrexone (ReVia, Vivitrol, in Embeda); pentazocine (Talwin); phenobarbital; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); 5HT3 serotonin blockers such as alosetron (Lotronex), dolasetron (Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril), ondansetron (Zofran, Zuplenz), or palonosetron (Aloxi); selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors such as citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Prozac, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), milnacipran (Savella), and venlafaxine (Effexor); tramadol (Conzip, Ultram, in Ultracet), and trazodone (Oleptro). Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or receiving the following medications or have stopped taking them in the past 14 days: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors including isocarboxazid (Marplan), linezolid (Zyvox), methylene blue, phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelpar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate). Many other medications may also interact with methadone, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. - tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort and tryptophan. - tell your doctor if you have any of the conditions mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section or have or have ever had paralytic ileus (condition in which digested food does not move through the intestines). Your doctor may tell you that you should not take methadone. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a blockage in your intestine; difficulty urinating; an enlarged prostate (a male reproductive gland); Addison's disease (a condition in which the adrenal gland does not make enough of certain natural substances); seizures; or thyroid, pancreas, gallbladder, liver, or kidney disease. - tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. If you breastfeed during your treatment with methadone, your baby may receive some methadone in breastmilk. Watch your baby closely for any changes in behavior or breathing, especially when you start taking methadone. If your baby develops any of these symptoms, call your baby's doctor immediately or get emergency medical help: unusual sleepiness, difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. Talk to your baby's doctor when you are ready to wean your baby.

39,40,methylprednisolole. unable to fine info on the above med,"Methylprednisolone: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Methylprednisolone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methylprednisolone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor. Stopping the drug abruptly can cause loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss. If you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely. Watch for these side effects if you are gradually decreasing your dose and after you stop taking the tablets. If these problems occur, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose of tablets temporarily or start taking them again. Before taking methylprednisolone, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to methylprednisolone, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), arthritis medications, aspirin, azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), digoxin (Lanoxin), diuretics ('water pills'), erythromycin, estrogen (Premarin), ketoconazole (Nizoral), oral contraceptives, phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), rifampin (Rifadin), theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamins. - if you have a fungal infection (other than on your skin), do not take methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver, kidney, intestinal, or heart disease; diabetes; an underactive thyroid gland; high blood pressure; mental illness; myasthenia gravis; osteoporosis; herpes eye infection; seizures; tuberculosis (TB); or ulcers. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking methylprednisolone, call your doctor. - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking methylprednisolone. - if you have a history of ulcers or take large doses of aspirin or other arthritis medication, limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking this drug. Methylprednisolone makes your stomach and intestines more susceptible to the irritating effects of alcohol, aspirin, and certain arthritis medications. This effect increases your risk of ulcers. Your doctor may instruct you to follow a low-sodium, low-salt, potassium-rich, or high-protein diet. Follow these directions. Methylprednisolone may cause an upset stomach. Take methylprednisolone with food or milk. When you start to take methylprednisolone, ask your doctor what to do if you forget a dose. Write down these instructions so that you can refer to them later. If you take methylprednisolone once a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Methylprednisolone may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - upset stomach - stomach irritation - vomiting - headache - dizziness - insomnia - restlessness - depression - anxiety - acne - increased hair growth - easy bruising - irregular or absent menstrual periods If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: - skin rash - swollen face, lower legs, or ankles - vision problems - cold or infection that lasts a long time - muscle weakness - black or tarry stool If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).

Carry an identification card that indicates that you may need to take supplementary doses (write down the full dose you took before gradually decreasing it) of methylprednisolone during periods of stress (injuries, infections, and severe asthma attacks). Ask your pharmacist or doctor how to obtain this card. List your name, medical problems, drugs and dosages, and doctor's name and telephone number on the card. This drug makes you more susceptible to illnesses. If you are exposed to chicken pox, measles, or tuberculosis (TB) while taking methylprednisolone, call your doctor. Do not have a vaccination, other immunization, or any skin test while you are taking methylprednisolone unless your doctor tells you that you may. Report any injuries or signs of infection (fever, sore throat, pain during urination, and muscle aches) that occur during treatment. Your doctor may instruct you to weigh yourself every day. Report any unusual weight gain. If your sputum (the matter you cough up during an asthma attack) thickens or changes color from clear white to yellow, green, or gray, call your doctor; these changes may be signs of an infection. If you have diabetes, methylprednisolone may increase your blood sugar level. If you monitor your blood sugar (glucose) at home, test your blood or urine more frequently than usual. Call your doctor if your blood sugar is high or if sugar is present in your urine; your dose of diabetes medication and your diet may need to be changed. Do not let anyone else take your medication.

Does electrical high voltage shock cause swallowing problems in the near future ??,"Swallowing problems: Difficulty with swallowing is the feeling that food or liquid is stuck in the throat or at any point before the food enters the stomach. This problem is also called dysphagia. This may be caused by a brain or nerve disorder, stress or anxiety, or problems that involve the tube leading from your throat to your stomach-the esophagus. Symptoms of swallowing problems include: - Coughing or choking, either during or after eating - Gurgling sounds from the throat, during or after eating - Throat clearing after drinking or swallowing - Slow chewing or eating - Coughing food back up after eating - Hiccups after swallowing - Chest discomfort during or after swallowing - Unexplained weight loss Symptoms may be mild or severe. Most people with dysphagia should be checked by a health care provider. But these general tips may help. - Keep mealtime relaxed. - Sit up as straight as possible when you eat. - Take small bites, less than 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of food per bite. - Chew well and swallow your food before taking another bite. - If one side of your face or mouth is weaker, chew food on the stronger side of your mouth. - DO NOT mix solid foods with liquids in the same bite. - DO NOT try to wash down solids with sips of liquids, unless your speech or swallowing therapist says this is OK. - DO NOT talk and swallow at the same time. - Sit upright for 30 to 45 minutes after eating. - DO NOT drink thin liquids without checking with your doctor or therapist first. You may need someone to remind you to finish swallowing. It may also help to ask caregivers and family members not to talk to you when you are eating or drinking.

44,45,Schmorl's Nodes. I am trying to obtain information on subject matter.,"Swollen lymph nodes: Swollen lymph nodes usually occur as a result of exposure to bacteria or viruses. When swollen lymph nodes are caused by an infection, this is known as lymphadenitis (lim-fad-uh-NIE-tis). Rarely, swollen lymph nodes are caused by cancer. Your lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in your body's ability to fight off infections. They function as filters, trapping viruses, bacteria and other causes of illnesses before they can infect other parts of your body. Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin. In some cases, the passage of time and warm compresses may be all you need to treat swollen lymph nodes. Treatment of lymphadenitis depends on the cause. Your lymphatic system is a network of organs, vessels and lymph nodes situated throughout your body. Many lymph nodes are located in your head and neck region. Lymph nodes that frequently swell are in this area, as well as in your armpits and groin area. Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that something is wrong somewhere in your body. When your lymph nodes first swell, you might notice: - Tenderness and pain in the lymph nodes - Swelling that may be the size of a pea or kidney bean, or even larger in the lymph nodes Depending on the cause of your swollen lymph nodes, other signs and symptoms you might have include: - Runny nose, sore throat, fever and other indications of an upper respiratory infection - General swelling of lymph nodes throughout your body - which may indicate an infection, such as HIV or mononucleosis, or an immune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis - Hard, fixed, rapidly growing nodes, indicating a possible tumor - Fever - Night sweats Some swollen lymph nodes return to normal when the underlying condition, such as a minor infection, gets better. See your doctor if you're concerned or if your swollen lymph nodes: - Have appeared for no apparent reason - Continue to enlarge or have been present for two to four weeks - Feel hard or rubbery, or don't move when you push on them - Are accompanied by persistent fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss Seek immediate medical care if you're having difficulty swallowing or breathing. A lymph node is a small, round or bean-shaped cluster of cells covered by a capsule of connective tissue. The cells are a combination of lymphocytes - which produce protein particles that capture invaders, such as viruses - and macrophages, which break down the captured material. Lymphocytes and macrophages filter your lymphatic fluid as it travels through your body and protect you by destroying invaders. Lymph nodes are located in groups, and each group drains a specific area of your body. You may be more likely to notice swelling in certain areas, such as in the lymph nodes in your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin. The site of the swollen lymph nodes may help identify the underlying cause. The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, particularly a viral infection, such as the common cold. Other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes include: - Strep throat - Measles - Ear infections - Infected (abscessed) tooth - Mononucleosis - Skin or wound infections, such as cellulitis - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - the virus that causes AIDS - Tuberculosis - Certain sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis - Toxoplasmosis - a parasitic infection resulting from contact with the feces of an infected cat or eating undercooked meat - Cat scratch fever - a bacterial infection from a cat scratch or bite - Lupus - a chronic inflammatory disease that can target your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs - Rheumatoid arthritis - a chronic inflammatory disease that targets the tissue that lines your joints (synovium) - Lymphoma - cancer that originates in your lymphatic system - Leukemia - cancer of your body's blood-forming tissue, including your bone marrow and lymphatic system - Other cancers that have spread (metastasized ) to lymph nodes Other possible but rare causes include certain medications, such as the anti-seizure medication phenytoin (Dilantin) and preventive medications for malaria. To diagnose what might be causing your swollen lymph nodes, your doctor may need: - Your medical history. In addition, your doctor will want to know when and how your swollen lymph nodes developed and if you have any other signs or symptoms. - A physical exam. Your doctor will also want to check lymph nodes near the surface of your skin for size, tenderness, warmth and texture. The site of your swollen lymph nodes and your other signs and symptoms will offer clues to the underlying cause. - Blood tests. Depending on what your doctor suspects is causing your swollen lymph nodes, certain blood tests may be done to confirm or exclude the suspected underlying condition. The specific tests will depend on the suspected cause, but most likely will include a complete blood count (CBC). This helps evaluate your overall health and detect a range of disorders, including infections and leukemia. - Imaging studies. A chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan of the affected area may help determine potential sources of infection or find tumors. - Lymph node biopsy. Your doctor may have you undergo a biopsy. He or she will remove a sample from a lymph node or even an entire lymph node for microscopic examination. Swollen lymph nodes caused by a virus may return to normal after the viral infection resolves. Antibiotics are not useful to treat viral infections. Treatment for swollen lymph nodes from other causes depends on the cause: - Infection. The most common treatment for swollen lymph nodes caused by a bacterial infection is antibiotics. If your swollen lymph nodes are due to an HIV infection, you'll receive specific treatment for that condition. - Immune disorder. If your swollen lymph nodes are a result of certain conditions, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, treatment is directed at the underlying condition. - Cancer. Swollen nodes caused by cancer require treatment for the cancer. Depending on the type of cancer, treatment may involve surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. If your swollen lymph nodes are tender or painful, you might get some relief by doing the following: - Apply a warm compress. Apply a warm, wet compress, such as a washcloth dipped in hot water and wrung out, to the affected area. - Take an over-the-counter pain reliever. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), naproxen (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns. - Get adequate rest. You often need rest to aid your recovery from the underlying condition.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-lymph-nodes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353902
45,46,Topic not covered. What exactly is sleep paralysis?,"Isolated sleep paralysis: Isolated sleep paralysis is a type of paralysis that occurs when a person just goes to sleep or upon waking from sleep. It is not associated with another sleep disorder. Episodes of isolated sleep paralysis last from a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes. During these episodes the person is unable to move or speak. Breathing is not affected. These spells end on their own or when the person is touched or moved. In rare cases, the person may have dream-like sensations or hallucinations, which may be scary to them. Sleep paralysis can be a symptom of narcolepsy. But if you do not have other symptoms of narcolepsy, there is usually no need to have sleep studies done. In most cases, isolated sleep paralysis occurs so rarely that treatment is not needed. If the cause is known, for example due to lack of sleep, correcting the cause, such as getting enough sleep, often resolves the condition. In persons with mental health conditions, medicine and behavioral therapy (talk therapy) to help treat the mental condition may resolve sleep paralysis. Updated by: Allen J.

This plan will tell you how to: - Avoid asthma triggers - Monitor symptoms - Measure peak flow - Take medicines The plan should also tell you when to call the provider. It is important to know what questions to ask your child's provider. Children with asthma need a lot of support at school. - Give the school staff your asthma action plan so they know how to take care of your child's asthma. - Find out how to let your child take medicine during school hours. (You may need to sign a consent form.) - Having asthma does not mean your child cannot exercise. Coaches, gym teachers, and your child should know what to do if your child has asthma symptoms caused by exercise. ASTHMA MEDICINES There are two basic kinds of medicine used to treat asthma. Long-term control drugs are taken every day to prevent asthma symptoms. Your child should take these medicines even if no symptoms are present. Some children may need more than one long-term control medicine. Types of long-term control medicines include: - Inhaled steroids (these are usually the first choice of treatment) - Long-acting bronchodilators (these are almost always used with inhaled steroids) - Leukotriene inhibitors - Cromolyn sodium Quick relief or rescue asthma drugs work fast to control asthma symptoms. Children take them when they are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. Some of your child's asthma medicines can be taken using an inhaler. - Children who use an inhaler should use a spacer device. This helps them get the medicine into the lungs properly. - If your child uses the inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets into the lungs. Have your provider show your child how to correctly use an inhaler. - Younger children can use a nebulizer instead of an inhaler to take their medicine. A nebulizer turns asthma medicine into a mist. GETTING RID OF TRIGGERS It is important to know your child's asthma triggers. Avoiding them is the first step toward helping your child feel better. Keep pets outdoors, or at least away from the child's bedroom. No one should smoke in a house or around a child with asthma. - Getting rid of tobacco smoke in the home is the single most important thing a family can do to help a child with asthma. - Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke carry the smoke inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. - DO NOT use indoor fireplaces. Keep the house clean. Keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches, which can trigger asthma attacks. Cleaning products in the home should be unscented. MONITOR YOUR CHILD'S ASTHMA Checking peak flow is one of the best ways to control asthma. It can help you keep your child's asthma from getting worse. Asthma attacks usually DO NOT happen without warning. Children under age 5 may not be able to use a peak flow meter well enough for it to be helpful. However, a child should start using the peak flow meter at a young age to get used to it. An adult should always watch for a child's asthma symptoms.",https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000990.htm
47,48,hi. I can't find this I take Ambien every night for sleep. I want to no how long before I go to bed am I supposed to take it.,"Sleep terrors (night terrors): Sleep terrors are episodes of screaming, intense fear and flailing while still asleep. Also known as night terrors, sleep terrors often are paired with sleepwalking. Like sleepwalking, sleep terrors are considered a parasomnia - an undesired occurrence during sleep. A sleep terror episode usually lasts from seconds to a few minutes, but episodes may last longer. Sleep terrors affect almost 40 percent of children and a much smaller percentage of adults. However frightening, sleep terrors aren't usually a cause for concern. Most children outgrow sleep terrors by their teenage years. Sleep terrors may require treatment if they cause problems getting enough sleep or they pose a safety risk. Sleep terrors differ from nightmares. The dreamer of a nightmare wakes up from the dream and may remember details, but a person who has a sleep terror episode remains asleep. Children usually don't remember anything about their sleep terrors in the morning. Adults may recall a dream fragment they had during the sleep terrors. Sleep terrors generally occur in the first third to first half of the night, and rarely during naps. A sleep terror may lead to sleepwalking. During a sleep terror episode, a person may: - Begin with a frightening scream or shout - Sit up in bed and appear frightened - Stare wide-eyed - Sweat, breathe heavily, and have a racing pulse, flushed face and dilated pupils - Kick and thrash - Be hard to awaken, and be confused if awakened - Be inconsolable - Have no or little memory of the event the next morning - Possibly, get out of bed and run around the house or have aggressive behavior if blocked or restrained Occasional sleep terrors aren't usually a cause for concern. If your child has sleep terrors, you can simply mention them at a routine well-child exam. However, consult your doctor if sleep terrors: - Become more frequent - Routinely disrupt the sleep of the person with sleep terrors or other family members - Lead to safety concerns or injury - Result in daytime symptoms of excessive sleepiness or problems functioning - Continue beyond the teen years or start in adulthood Sleep terrors are classified as a parasomnia - an undesirable behavior or experience during sleep. Sleep terrors are a disorder of arousal, meaning they occur during N3 sleep, the deepest stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Another NREM disorder is sleepwalking, which can occur together with sleep terrors. Various factors can contribute to sleep terrors, such as: - Sleep deprivation and extreme tiredness - Stress - Sleep schedule disruptions, travel or sleep interruptions - Fever Sleep terrors sometimes can be triggered by underlying conditions that interfere with sleep, such as: - Sleep-disordered breathing - a group of disorders that include abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, the most common of which is obstructive sleep apnea - Restless legs syndrome - Some medications - Mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety - In adults, alcohol use Sleep terrors are more common if family members have a history of sleep terrors or sleepwalking. In children, sleep terrors are more common in females. To diagnose sleep terrors, your doctor reviews your medical history and your symptoms. Your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam to identify any conditions that may be contributing to the sleep terrors. - Discussing your symptoms. Sleep terrors are usually diagnosed by your doctor based on your description of the events. Your doctor may ask about your family history of sleep problems. Your doctor may also ask you or your partner to fill out a questionnaire about your sleep behaviors. - Nocturnal sleep study (polysomnography). In some cases, your doctor may recommend an overnight study in a sleep lab. Sensors placed on your body record and monitor brain waves, the oxygen level in your blood, heart rate and breathing, as well as eye and leg movements while you sleep. You may be videotaped to document your behavior during sleep cycles. Treatment for infrequent sleep terrors isn't usually necessary. If the sleep terrors lead to the potential for injury, are disruptive to family members, or result in embarrassment or sleep disruption for the person who has sleep terrors, treatment may be needed. Treatment generally focuses on promoting safety and eliminating causes or triggers. Treatment options may include: - Treating any underlying condition. If the sleep terrors are associated with an underlying medical or mental health condition or another sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea, treatment is aimed at the underlying problem. - Addressing stress. If stress or anxiety seems to be contributing to the sleep terrors, your doctor may suggest meeting with a therapist or counselor. Cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, biofeedback or relaxation therapy may help. - Anticipatory awakening. This involves waking the person who has sleep terrors about 15 minutes before he or she usually experiences the event. Then the person stays awake for a few minutes before falling asleep again. - Medication. Medication is rarely used to treat sleep terrors, particularly for children. If necessary, however, use of benzodiazepines or certain antidepressants may be effective. Lifestyle and home remedies If sleep terrors are a problem for you or your child, here are some strategies to try: - Get adequate sleep. Fatigue can contribute to sleep terrors. If you're sleep deprived, try an earlier bedtime and a more regular sleep schedule. Sometimes a short nap may help. If possible, avoid sleep-time noises or other stimuli that could interrupt sleep. - Establish a regular, relaxing routine before bedtime. Do quiet, calming activities - such as reading books, doing puzzles or soaking in a warm bath - before bed. Meditation or relaxation exercises may help, too. Make the bedroom comfortable and quiet for sleep. - Make the environment safe. To help prevent injury, close and lock all windows and exterior doors at night. You might even lock interior doors or put alarms or bells on them. Block doorways or stairways with a gate, and move electrical cords or other objects that pose a tripping hazard. Avoid using bunk beds. Place any sharp or fragile objects out of reach, and lock up all weapons. - Put stress in its place. Identify the things that stress you out, and brainstorm possible ways to handle the stress. If your child seems anxious or stressed, talk about what's bothering him or her. A mental health professional can help. - Offer comfort. If your child has a sleep terror episode, consider simply waiting it out. It may be distressing to watch, but it won't harm your child. You might cuddle and gently soothe your child and try to get him or her back into bed. Speak softly and calmly. Shaking your child or shouting may make things worse. Usually the episode will shortly stop on its own. - Look for a pattern. If your child has sleep terrors, keep a sleep diary. For several nights, note how many minutes after bedtime a sleep terror episode occurs. If the timing is fairly consistent, anticipatory awakenings may help.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-terrors/symptoms-causes/syc-20353524
48,49,bundle blockage. could you please tell me what a bundle blockage is. what are the symptoms. what is usually done for this? Thank you,"Bundle branch block: Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers (ventricles) of your heart. Bundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system. There's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated. In most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block. For those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: - Fainting (syncope) - Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope) When to see a doctor If you've fainted, see your doctor to rule out any serious, underlying causes. If you have heart disease, or if your doctor has already diagnosed you as having bundle branch block, ask your doctor how often you should have follow-up visits. You might want to carry a medical alert card that identifies you as having bundle branch block in case you're seen in an emergency by a doctor who isn't familiar with your medical history. Normally, electrical impulses within your heart's muscle signal it to beat (contract). These impulses travel along a pathway, including the right and the left bundles. If one or both of these branch bundles become damaged - due to a heart attack, for example - this change can block the electrical impulses and cause your heart to beat abnormally. The underlying cause for bundle branch blocks may differ depending on whether the left or right bundle branch is affected. It's also possible that this condition can occur without any known underlying cause. Specific causes may include: Left bundle branch block - Heart disease - Thickened, stiffened or weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) - A viral or bacterial infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) - High blood pressure (hypertension) Right bundle branch block - A heart abnormality that's present at birth (congenital) - such as atrial septal defect, a hole in the wall separating the upper chambers of the heart - A heart attack (myocardial infarction) - A viral or bacterial infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) - High blood pressure (hypertension) - A blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) Risk factors for bundle branch block include: - Increasing age. Bundle branch block is more common in older adults than in people who are middle-aged. - Underlying health problems. People who have high blood pressure or heart disease are more likely to have bundle branch block than people without those conditions. Tests that may be used to diagnose a bundle branch block or the underlying problem causing it include: - Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram records the electrical impulses in your heart through wires attached to the skin on your chest and other locations on your body. Abnormalities may indicate the presence of bundle branch block, as well as which side is being affected. - Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram can be used to pinpoint an underlying condition that caused the bundle branch block. This test uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, allowing your doctor to see your heart in motion. An echocardiogram provides detailed images of the heart's structure and shows the thickness of your heart muscle and whether your heart valves are moving normally. Most people with bundle branch block are symptom-free and don't need treatment. However, if you have an underlying heart condition causing bundle branch block, treatment of the underlying condition is recommended. Treatment of underlying conditions may involve using medications to reduce high blood pressure or lessen the effects of heart failure, or the use of a coronary angioplasty to open up the artery leading to your heart. Additionally, depending on your symptoms and whether you have other heart problems, your doctor might also recommend: - A pacemaker. For some people with bundle branch block and a history of fainting, doctors may recommend implanting a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a compact device implanted under the skin of your upper chest (internal pacemaker) with two wires that connect to the right side of your heart. The pacemaker provides electrical impulses when needed to keep your heart beating regularly. - Cardiac resynchronization. Also known as biventricular pacing, this procedure is similar to having a pacemaker implanted. However, in cardiac resynchronization, there's a third wire that's connected to the left side of the heart so the device can keep both sides in proper rhythm.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bundle-branch-block/symptoms-causes/syc-20370514

50,51,Arrhthmia. can arrhythmia occurs after ablation? What is the success rate of Ablation? During my Holter test it was found that my Heart rate fluctuates from 254 to 21. How do you rate the situation?,"Heart arrhythmia (Diagnosis): To diagnose a heart arrhythmia, your doctor will review your symptoms and your medical history and conduct a physical examination. Your doctor may ask about - or test for - conditions that may trigger your arrhythmia, such as heart disease or a problem with your thyroid gland. Your doctor may also perform heart-monitoring tests specific to arrhythmias. These may include: - Electrocardiogram (ECG). During an ECG, sensors (electrodes) that can detect the electrical activity of your heart are attached to your chest and sometimes to your limbs. An ECG measures the timing and duration of each electrical phase in your heartbeat. - Holter monitor. This portable ECG device can be worn for a day or more to record your heart's activity as you go about your routine. - Event monitor. For sporadic arrhythmias, you keep this portable ECG device available, attaching it to your body and pressing a button when you have symptoms. This lets your doctor check your heart rhythm at the time of your symptoms. - Echocardiogram. In this noninvasive test, a hand-held device (transducer) placed on your chest uses sound waves to produce images of your heart's size, structure and motion. - Implantable loop recorder. This device detects abnormal heart rhythms and is implanted under the skin in the chest area. If your doctor doesn't find an arrhythmia during those tests, he or she may try to trigger your arrhythmia with other tests, which may include: - Stress test. Some arrhythmias are triggered or worsened by exercise. During a stress test, you'll be asked to exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle while your heart activity is monitored. If doctors are evaluating you to determine if coronary artery disease may be causing the arrhythmia, and you have difficulty exercising, then your doctor may use a drug to stimulate your heart in a way that's similar to exercise. - Tilt table test. Your doctor may recommend this test if you've had fainting spells. Your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored as you lie flat on a table. The table is then tilted as if you were standing up. Your doctor observes how your heart and the nervous system that controls it respond to the change in angle. - Electrophysiological testing and mapping. In this test, doctors thread thin, flexible tubes (catheters) tipped with electrodes through your blood vessels to a variety of spots within your heart. Once in place, the electrodes can map the spread of electrical impulses through your heart. In addition, your cardiologist can use the electrodes to stimulate your heart to beat at rates that may trigger - or halt - an arrhythmia. This allows your doctor to see the location of the arrhythmia and what may be causing it.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668

54,55,general health. How do you catch hepatitis?,"Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A is inflammation (irritation and swelling) of the liver from the hepatitis A virus. The hepatitis A virus is found mostly in the stool and blood of an infected person. The virus is present about 15 to 45 days before symptoms occur and during the first week of illness. You can catch hepatitis A if: - You eat or drink food or water that has been contaminated by stools (feces) containing the hepatitis A virus. Unpeeled and uncooked fruits and vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease. - You come in contact with the stool or blood of a person who currently has the disease. - A person with hepatitis A passes the virus to an object or food due to poor hand-washing after using the toilet. - You take part in sexual practices that involve oral-anal contact. Not everyone has symptoms with hepatitis A infection. Therefore, many more people are infected than are diagnosed or reported. Risk factors include: - Overseas travel, especially to Asia, South or Central America, Africa and the Middle East  - IV drug use - Living in a nursing home center - Working in a health care, food, or sewage industry Other common hepatitis virus infections include hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Hepatitis A is the least serious and mildest of these diseases. Symptoms most often show up 2 to 6 weeks after being exposed to the hepatitis A virus. They are most often mild, but may last for up to several months, especially in adults. Symptoms include: - Dark urine - Fatigue - Itching - Loss of appetite - Low-grade fever - Nausea and vomiting - Pale or clay-colored stools - Yellow skin (jaundice) The health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may show that your liver is enlarged and tender. Blood tests may show: - Raised IgM and IgG antibodies to hepatitis A (IgM is usually positive before IgG) - Elevated liver enzymes (liver function tests), especially transaminase enzyme levels There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. - You should rest and stay well hydrated when the symptoms are the worst. - People with acute hepatitis should avoid alcohol and drugs that are toxic to the liver, including acetaminophen (Tylenol) during the acute illness and for several months after recovery. - Fatty foods may cause vomiting and are best avoided during the acute phase of the illness. The virus does not remain in the body after the infection is gone. Most people with hepatitis A recover within 3 months. Nearly all people get better within 6 months. There is no lasting damage once you've recovered. Also, you can't get the disease again. There is a low risk of death. The risk is higher among older adults and people with long-term liver disease.  Call your provider if you have symptoms of hepatitis. The following tips can help reduce your risk of spreading or catching the virus: - Always wash your hands well after using the restroom, and when you come in contact with an infected person's blood, stools, or other bodily fluid. - Avoid unclean food and water. The virus may spread more rapidly through day care centers and other places where people are in close contact. Thorough hand washing before and after each diaper change, before serving food, and after using the toilet may help prevent such outbreaks. Ask your provider about getting either immune globulin or the hepatitis A vaccine if you are exposed to the disease and have not had hepatitis A or the hepatitis A vaccine. Common reasons for getting one or both of these treatments include: - You have hepatitis B or C or any form of long-term liver disease. - You live with someone who has hepatitis A. - You recently had sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A. - You recently shared illegal drugs, either injected or noninjected, with someone who has hepatitis A. - You have had close personal contact over a period of time with someone who has hepatitis A. - You have eaten in a restaurant where food or food handlers were found to be infected or contaminated with hepatitis. - You are planning travel to where hepatitis A is common. Vaccines that protect against hepatitis A infection are available. The vaccine begins to protect 4 weeks after you get the first dose. You will need to get a booster shot 6 to 12 months later for long-term protection. Travelers should take the following steps to protect against getting the disease: - Avoid dairy products. - Avoid raw or undercooked meat and fish. - Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in unclean water. Travelers should peel all fresh fruits and vegetables themselves. - DO NOT buy food from street vendors. - Get vaccinated against hepatitis A (and possibly hepatitis B) if traveling to countries where outbreaks of the disease occur. - Use only carbonated bottled water for brushing teeth and drinking. (Remember that ice cubes can carry infection.) - If bottled water is not available, boiling water is the best way to get rid of hepatitis A. Bring the water to a full boil for at least 1 minute to make it safe to drink. - Heated food should be hot to the touch and eaten right away. Updated by: Michael M.

58,59,general health. Is there always elevated temperature associated with appendicitis?,"General anesthesia: General anesthesia is treatment with certain medicines that puts you into a deep sleep so you do not feel pain during surgery. After you receive these medicines, you will not be aware of what is happening around you. Most times, a doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you the anesthesia. Sometimes, a certified and registered nurse anesthetist will take care of you. The medicine is given into your vein. You may be asked to breathe in (inhale) a special gas through a mask. Once you are asleep, the doctor may insert a tube into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe and protect your lungs. You will be watched very closely while you are asleep. Your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing will be monitored. The health care provider taking care of you can change how deeply asleep you are during the surgery. You will not move, feel any pain, or have any memory of the procedure because of this medicine. General anesthesia is a safe way to stay asleep and pain-free during procedures that would: - Be too painful - Take a long time - Affect your ability to breathe - Make you uncomfortable - Cause too much anxiety You may also be able to have conscious sedation for your procedure. Sometimes, though, it is not enough to make you comfortable. Children may need general anesthesia for a medical or dental procedure to handle any pain or anxiety they may feel. General anesthesia is usually safe for healthy people. You may have a higher risk of problems with general anesthesia if you: - Abuse alcohol or medicines - Have allergies or a family history of being allergic to medicines - Have heart, lung, or kidney problems - Smoke Ask your doctor about these complications: - Death (rare) - Harm to your vocal cords - Heart attack - Lung infection - Mental confusion (temporary) - Stroke - Trauma to the teeth or tongue - Waking during anesthesia (rare) - Allergy to the drugs - Malignant hyperthermia (fast rise in body temperature and severe muscle contractions) Tell your provider: - If you could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the surgery: - An anesthesiologist will take a complete medical history to determine the type and amount of the anesthesia you need. This includes asking you about any allergies, health conditions, medicines, and history of anesthesia. - Several days to a week before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking blood thinning drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven). - Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. - Always try to stop smoking. Your doctor can help. On the day of your surgery: - You will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery. This is to prevent you from vomiting while you are under the effect of the anesthesia. Vomiting can cause food in the stomach to be inhaled into the lungs. This can lead to breathing problems. - Take the drugs that your provider told you to take with a small sip of water. - Arrive at the hospital on time. You will wake up tired and groggy in the recovery or operating room. You may also feel sick to your stomach, and have a dry mouth, sore throat, or feel cold or restless until the effect of the anesthesia wears off. Your nurse will monitor these side effects, which will wear off, but it may take a few hours. Sometimes, nausea and vomiting can be treated with other medicines. Follow your surgeon's instructions while you recover and care for your surgical wound. General anesthesia is generally safe because of modern equipment, medicines, and safety standards. Most people recover completely and do not have any complications. Updated by: Mary C.

Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, has overused prescription medications, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness. There is a greater risk that you will overuse hydrocodone if you have or have ever had any of these conditions. Do not allow anyone else to take your medication. Hydrocodone may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Keep hydrocodone in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Be especially careful to keep hydrocodone out of the reach of children. Keep track of how many capsules or tablets are left so you will know if any medication is missing. Hydrocodone may cause slowed or stopped breathing, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Your doctor will adjust your dose to control your pain and decrease the risk that you will experience serious breathing problems. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take hydrocodone. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways), a head injury, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain. The risk that you will develop breathing problems may be higher if you are an older adult or are weakened or malnourished due to disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath. Taking certain medications or stopping treatment with certain other medications while you are taking hydrocodone may increase the risk that you will experience breathing problems, sedation, coma, or other serious, life-threatening side effects. Tell your doctor if you are taking, plan to take or plan to stop taking any of the following medications: certain antifungal medications including itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox), ketoconazole (Extina, Nizoral, Xolegel), and voriconazole (Vfend); benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Diastat, Valium), estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam (Ativan), oxazepam, temazepam (Restoril), and triazolam (Halcion); carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol, others); cimetidine; clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac); erythromycin (E.E.S., Erythromycin, others); other narcotic pain medications; medications for mental illness or nausea; certain medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra, in Viekira Pak); muscle relaxants; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); sedatives; sleeping pills; or tranquilizers. If you take hydrocodone with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Drinking alcohol, taking prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with hydrocodone increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Do not drink alcohol, take prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or use street drugs during your treatment. Swallow hydrocodone extended-release capsules or extended-release tablets whole; do not chew, break, divide, crush, or dissolve them. Hydrocodone extended-release capsules and extended-release tablets are difficult to crush, break or dissolve. If you swallow broken, chewed, or crushed extended-release capsules or extended-release tablets, you may receive too much hydrocodone at once. This may cause serious problems, including overdose and death. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take hydrocodone regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth. Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms: irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep, high-pitched cry, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, vomiting, diarrhea, or failure to gain weight. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with hydrocodone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking hydrocodone. Hydrocodone is used to relieve severe pain. Hydrocodone is only used to treat people who are expected to need medication to relieve severe pain around-the-clock for a long time and who cannot be treated with other medications or treatments. Hydrocodone extended-release (long-acting) capsules or extended-release tablets should not be used to treat pain that can be controlled by medication that is taken as needed. Hydrocodone is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. It works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. This monograph only includes information about the use of hydrocodone alone. If you are taking a hydrocodone combination product, be sure to read information about all the ingredients in the hydrocodone-combination monograph and ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Hydrocodone comes as an extended-release (long-acting) capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once every 12 hours. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once daily. Take hydrocodone at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take hydrocodone exactly as directed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release capsules or extended-release tablets one at a time with plenty of water. Swallow each capsule or tablet as soon as you put it in your mouth. Do not presoak, wet, or lick the extended-release tablets before you put them in your mouth. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of hydrocodone and may gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 3 to 7 days if needed to control your pain. After your take hydrocodone for a period of time, your body may become used to the medication. If this happens, your doctor may increase your dose of hydrocodone or may prescribe a different medication to help control your pain. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with hydrocodone. Do not stop taking hydrocodone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking hydrocodone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, hair standing on end, muscle pain, widened pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes), irritability, anxiety, back or joint pain, weakness, stomach cramps, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, fast breathing, or fast heartbeat. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

If you become pregnant while taking lisinopril, call your doctor immediately. Lisinopril may harm the fetus. Lisinopril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is used in combination with other medications to treat heart failure. Lisinopril is also used to improve survival after a heart attack. Lisinopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation. Lisinopril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take lisinopril, take it around the same time every day.

65,66,meds taken with wine at dinnertime. Is it safe to take my meds with wine at dinnertime?,"Port-wine stain: A port-wine stain is a birthmark in which swollen blood vessels create a reddish-purplish discoloration of the skin. Port-wine stains are caused by an abnormal formation of tiny blood vessels in the skin. In rare cases, port-wine stains are a sign of Sturge-Weber syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. Early-stage port-wine stains are usually flat and pink. As the child gets older, the stain grows with the child and the color may deepen to dark red or purple. Port-wine stains occur most often on the face, but can appear anywhere on the body. Over time, the area can become thickened and take on a cobblestone-like appearance. The health care provider can usually diagnose a port-wine stain by looking at the skin. In a few cases, a skin biopsy is needed. Depending on the location of the birthmark and other symptoms, the provider may want to do an intraocular pressure test or x-ray of the skull. An MRI or CT scan of the brain may also be done. Many treatments have been tried for port-wine stains, including freezing, surgery, radiation, and tattooing. Laser therapy is most successful in removing port-wine stains. It is the only method that can destroy the tiny blood vessels in the skin without causing much damage to the skin. The exact type of laser used depends on the person's age, skin type, and particular port-wine stain. Stains on the face respond better to laser therapy than those on the arms, legs, or middle of the body. Older stains may be more difficult to treat. Complications may include: - Deformity and increasing disfigurement - Emotional and social problems related to their appearance - Development of glaucoma in people with port-wine stains involving upper and lower eyelids - Neurologic problems when port-wine stain is associated with a disorder such as Sturge-Weber syndrome All birthmarks should be evaluated by the provider during a routine examination.

67,68,general health. What are the reasons for Hypoglycemia in newborns.. and what steps should a pregnent take to avoid this.,"Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia is a condition caused by a very low level of blood sugar (glucose), your body's main energy source. Hypoglycemia is often related to the treatment of diabetes. However, a variety of conditions - many rare - can cause low blood sugar in people without diabetes. Like fever, hypoglycemia isn't a disease itself - it's an indicator of a health problem. Immediate treatment of hypoglycemia is necessary when blood sugar levels are at 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or below. Treatment involves quick steps to get your blood sugar level back into a normal range either with high-sugar foods or drinks or with medications. Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the underlying cause of hypoglycemia. If blood sugar levels become too low, signs and symptoms may include: - An irregular heart rhythm - Fatigue - Pale skin - Shakiness - Anxiety - Sweating - Hunger - Irritability - Tingling sensation around the mouth - Crying out during sleep As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms may include: - Confusion, abnormal behavior or both, such as the inability to complete routine tasks - Visual disturbances, such as blurred vision - Seizures - Loss of consciousness People with severe hypoglycemia may appear as if they're intoxicated. They may slur their words and move clumsily. When to see a doctor Seek a doctor's help immediately if: - You have what may be symptoms of hypoglycemia and you don't have diabetes. - You have diabetes and hypoglycemia isn't responding to treatment. Initial treatment of hypoglycemia is drinking juice or regular soft drinks, eating candy or taking glucose tablets. If this treatment doesn't raise your blood sugar and improve your symptoms, contact your doctor right away. Seek emergency help if: - Someone with diabetes or a history of recurring hypoglycemia has symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or loses consciousness Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria. - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia. - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery. If you ignore the symptoms of hypoglycemia too long, you may lose consciousness. That's because your brain needs glucose to function properly. Recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia early because untreated hypoglycemia can lead to: - Seizure - Loss of consciousness - Death Hypoglcemia can also contribute to: - Falls - Injuries - Motor vehicle accidents Hypoglycemia unawareness Over time, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness. The body and brain no longer produce signs and symptoms that warn of a low blood sugar, such as shakiness or irregular heartbeats. When this happens, the risk of severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia is increased. Undertreated diabetes If you have diabetes, episodes of low blood sugar are uncomfortable and can be frightening. Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia may cause you to take less insulin to ensure that your blood sugar level doesn't go too low. But long-term high blood sugar levels can be dangerous too, possibly causing damage to your nerves, blood vessels and various organs. If you use insulin or another diabetes medication known to lower blood sugar, and you have signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, test your blood sugar levels with a blood glucose meter. If the result shows low blood sugar (under 70 mg/dL), treat accordingly. If you don't use medications known to cause hypoglycemia, your doctor will want to know: - What were your signs and symptoms? You may not exhibit signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during your initial visit with your doctor. In this case, your doctor may have you fast overnight (or for a longer period). This will allow low blood sugar symptoms to occur so that he or she can make a diagnosis. It's also possible that you'll need to undergo an extended fast in a hospital setting. Or if your symptoms occur after a meal, your doctor will want to test your glucose levels after a meal. - What is your blood sugar level when you're having symptoms? Your doctor will draw a sample of your blood to be analyzed in the laboratory. - Do your symptoms disappear when blood sugar levels increase? In addition, your doctor will likely conduct a physical examination and review your medical history. Treatment of hypoglycemia involves: - Immediate initial treatment to raise your blood sugar level - Treatment of the underlying condition that's causing your hypoglycemia to prevent it from recurring Immediate initial treatment The initial treatment depends on your symptoms. Early symptoms can usually be treated by consuming 15 to 20 grams of a fast-acting carbohydrate. Fast-acting carbohydrates are foods that are easily converted to sugar in the body, such as glucose tablets or gel, fruit juice, regular - not diet - soft drinks, and sugary candy such as licorice. Foods containing fat or protein aren't good treatments for hypoglycemia, because they affect the body's absorption of sugar. Recheck blood sugar levels 15 minutes after treatment. If blood sugar levels are still under 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), treat with another 15 to 20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate, and recheck the blood sugar level again in 15 minutes. Repeat these steps until the blood sugar is above 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Once the blood sugar levels are back to normal, it's important to have a snack or meal to help stabilize your blood sugar. This also helps the body replenish glycogen stores that may have been depleted during hypoglycemia. If your symptoms are more severe, impairing your ability to take sugar by mouth, you may need an injection of glucagon or intravenous glucose. Do not give food or drink to someone who is unconscious, as he or she may aspirate these substances into the lungs. If you're prone to severe episodes of hypoglycemia, ask your doctor if a home glucagon kit might be appropriate for you. In general, people with diabetes who are treated with insulin should have a glucagon kit for low blood sugar emergencies. Family and friends need to know where to find the kit, and need to be taught how to use it before an emergency occurs. Treatment of the underlying condition Preventing recurrent hypoglycemia requires your doctor to identify the underlying condition and treat it. Depending on the underlying cause, treatment may involve: - Medications. If a medication is the cause of your hypoglycemia, your doctor will likely suggest changing the medication or adjusting the dosage. - Tumor treatment. A tumor in your pancreas is treated by surgical removal of the tumor. In some cases, partial removal of the pancreas is necessary.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685
68,69,diverticulitis. can diverticulosis or diverticulitis be detected by a cat scan if there is no infection at that time?,"Diverticulitis (Diagnosis): Diverticulitis is usually diagnosed during an acute attack. Because abdominal pain can indicate a number of problems, your doctor will need to rule out other causes for your symptoms. Your doctor will likely start with a physical examination, including checking your abdomen for tenderness. Women, in addition, generally have a pelvic examination to rule out pelvic disease. After that, your doctor will likely recommend: - Blood and urine tests, to check for signs of infection. - Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age, to rule out pregnancy as a cause of abdominal pain. - Liver function tests, to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. - Stool test, to rule out infection in people who have diarrhea. - CT scan, which can indicate inflamed or infected pouches and confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis. CT can also indicate the severity of diverticulitis and guide treatment. Diagnosis at Mayo Clinic Diverticulitis can be difficult to diagnose because abdominal pain is a symptom of many digestive disorders. Mayo Clinic has radiologists who specialize in digestive disorders and have experience distinguishing diverticulitis from other conditions. Mayo's digestive disease specialists (gastroenterologists) have experience diagnosing the severity of diverticulitis.

Who is right & what is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? Pharmacy is a non-public pharmacy for a major city employer plan provided for employees only.,"Type 2 diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), your body's important source of fuel. With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin - a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells - or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. More common in adults, type 2 diabetes increasingly affects children as childhood obesity increases. There's no cure for type 2 diabetes, but you may be able to manage the condition by eating well, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar well, you also may need diabetes medications or insulin therapy. Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly. In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. Look for: - Increased thirst and frequent urination. Excess sugar building up in your bloodstream causes fluid to be pulled from the tissues. This may leave you thirsty. As a result, you may drink - and urinate - more than usual. - Increased hunger. Without enough insulin to move sugar into your cells, your muscles and organs become depleted of energy. This triggers intense hunger. - Weight loss. Despite eating more than usual to relieve hunger, you may lose weight. Without the ability to metabolize glucose, the body uses alternative fuels stored in muscle and fat. Calories are lost as excess glucose is released in the urine. - Fatigue. If your cells are deprived of sugar, you may become tired and irritable. - Blurred vision. If your blood sugar is too high, fluid may be pulled from the lenses of your eyes. This may affect your ability to focus. - Slow-healing sores or frequent infections. Type 2 diabetes affects your ability to heal and resist infections. - Areas of darkened skin. Some people with type 2 diabetes have patches of dark, velvety skin in the folds and creases of their bodies - usually in the armpits and neck. This condition, called acanthosis nigricans, may be a sign of insulin resistance. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you notice any type 2 diabetes symptoms. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas stops producing enough insulin. Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as excess weight and inactivity, seem to be contributing factors. How insulin works Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas). - The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. - The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. - Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. - As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose Glucose - a sugar - is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. - Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. - Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. - Your liver stores and makes glucose. - When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands. In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin. Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: - Weight. Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes. - Fat distribution. If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs. - Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. - Family history. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. - Race. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races - including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans - are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites are. - Age. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45. That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults. - Prediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes. - Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. - Polycystic ovarian syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome - a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity - increases the risk of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes can be easy to ignore, especially in the early stages when you're feeling fine. But diabetes affects many major organs, including your heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Controlling your blood sugar levels can help prevent these complications. Although long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually, they can eventually be disabling or even life-threatening. Some of the potential complications of diabetes include: - Heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure. - Nerve damage (neuropathy). Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar can eventually cause you to lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. - Kidney damage (nephropathy). The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which often eventually requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Eye damage. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. - Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation. - Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. - Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. - Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. The exact connection between these two conditions still remains unclear. To diagnose type 2 diabetes, you'll be given a: - Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test. This blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. It measures the percentage of blood sugar attached to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more hemoglobin you'll have with sugar attached. An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes. A result between 5.7 and 6.4 percent is considered prediabetes, which indicates a high risk of developing diabetes. Normal levels are below 5.7 percent. If the A1C test isn't available, or if you have certain conditions - such as if you're pregnant or have an uncommon form of hemoglobin (known as a hemoglobin variant) - that can make the A1C test inaccurate, your doctor may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes: - Random blood sugar test. A blood sample will be taken at a random time. Blood sugar values are expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Regardless of when you last ate, a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher suggests diabetes, especially when coupled with any of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, such as frequent urination and extreme thirst. - Fasting blood sugar test. A blood sample will be taken after an overnight fast. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes. - Oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, you fast overnight, and the fasting blood sugar level is measured. Then you drink a sugary liquid, and blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes. A reading of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher after two hours may indicate diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends routine screening for type 2 diabetes beginning at age 45, especially if you're overweight. If the results are normal, repeat the test every three years. If the results are borderline, ask your doctor when to come back for another test. Screening is also recommended for people who are under 45 and overweight if there are other heart disease or diabetes risk factors present, such as a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of type 2 diabetes, a personal history of gestational diabetes or blood pressure above 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). If you're diagnosed with diabetes, the doctor may do other tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes - since the two conditions often require different treatments. After the diagnosis A1C levels need to be checked between two and four times a year. Your target A1C goal may vary depending on your age and other factors. However, for most people, the American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C level below 7 percent. Ask your doctor what your A1C target is. Compared with repeated daily blood sugar tests, the A1C test is a better indicator of how well your diabetes treatment plan is working. An elevated A1C level may signal the need for a change in your medication, meal plan or activity level. In addition to the A1C test, your doctor will take blood and urine samples periodically to check your cholesterol levels, thyroid function, liver function and kidney function. The doctor will also assess your blood pressure. Regular eye and foot exams also are important. Management of type 2 diabetes includes: - Healthy eating - Regular exercise - Possibly, diabetes medication or insulin therapy - Blood sugar monitoring These steps will help keep your blood sugar level closer to normal, which can delay or prevent complications. Healthy eating Contrary to popular perception, there's no specific diabetes diet. However, it's important to center your diet on these high-fiber, low-fat foods: - Fruits - Vegetables - Whole grains You'll also need to eat fewer animal products, refined carbohydrates and sweets. Low glycemic index foods also may be helpful. The glycemic index is a measure of how quickly a food causes a rise in your blood sugar. Foods with a high glycemic index raise your blood sugar quickly. Low glycemic index foods may help you achieve a more stable blood sugar. Foods with a low glycemic index typically are foods that are higher in fiber. A registered dietitian can help you put together a meal plan that fits your health goals, food preferences and lifestyle. He or she can also teach you how to monitor your carbohydrate intake and let you know about how many carbohydrates you need to eat with your meals and snacks to keep your blood sugar levels more stable. Physical activity Everyone needs regular aerobic exercise, and people who have type 2 diabetes are no exception. Get your doctor's OK before you start an exercise program. Then choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming and biking. What's most important is making physical activity part of your daily routine. Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five days of the week. Stretching and strength training exercises are important, too. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up gradually. A combination of exercises - aerobic exercises, such as walking or dancing on most days, combined with resistance training, such as weightlifting or yoga twice a week - often helps control blood sugar more effectively than either type of exercise alone. Remember that physical activity lowers blood sugar. Check your blood sugar level before any activity. You might need to eat a snack before exercising to help prevent low blood sugar if you take diabetes medications that lower your blood sugar. Monitoring your blood sugar Depending on your treatment plan, you may need to check and record your blood sugar level every now and then or, if you're on insulin, multiple times a day. Ask your doctor how often he or she wants you to check your blood sugar. Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range. Sometimes, blood sugar levels can be unpredictable. With help from your diabetes treatment team, you'll learn how your blood sugar level changes in response to food, exercise, alcohol, illness and medication. Diabetes medications and insulin therapy Some people who have type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone, but many also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy. The decision about which medications are best depends on many factors, including your blood sugar level and any other health problems you have. Your doctor might even combine drugs from different classes to help you control your blood sugar in several different ways. Examples of possible treatments for type 2 diabetes include: - Metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others). Generally, metformin is the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works by improving the sensitivity of your body tissues to insulin so that your body uses insulin more effectively. Metformin also lowers glucose production in the liver. Metformin may not lower blood sugar enough on its own. Your doctor will also recommend lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and becoming more active. Nausea and diarrhea are possible side effects of metformin. These side effects usually go away as your body gets used to the medicine. If metformin and lifestyles changes aren't enough to control your blood sugar level, other oral or injected medications can be added. - Sulfonylureas. These medications help your body secrete more insulin. Examples of medications in this class include glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol) and glimepiride (Amaryl). Possible side effects include low blood sugar and weight gain. - Meglitinides. These medications work like sulfonylureas by stimulating the pancreas to secrete more insulin, but they're faster acting, and the duration of their effect in the body is shorter. They also have a risk of causing low blood sugar, but this risk is lower than with sulfonylureas. Weight gain is a possibility with this class of medications as well. Examples include repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglinide (Starlix). - Thiazolidinediones. Like metformin, these medications make the body's tissues more sensitive to insulin. This class of medications has been linked to weight gain and other more-serious side effects, such as an increased risk of heart failure and fractures. Because of these risks, these medications generally aren't a first-choice treatment. Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) are examples of thiazolidinediones. - DPP-4 inhibitors. These medications help reduce blood sugar levels, but tend to have a modest effect. They don't cause weight gain. Examples of these medications are sitagliptin (Januvia), saxagliptin (Onglyza) and linagliptin (Tradjenta). - GLP-1 receptor agonists. These medications slow digestion and help lower blood sugar levels, though not as much as sulfonylureas. Their use is often associated with some weight loss. This class of medications isn't recommended for use by itself. Exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza) are examples of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Possible side effects include nausea and an increased risk of pancreatitis. - SGLT2 inhibitors. These are the newest diabetes drugs on the market. They work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar into the blood. Instead, the sugar is excreted in the urine. Examples include canagliflozin (Invokana) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga). Side effects may include yeast infections and urinary tract infections, increased urination and hypotension. - Insulin therapy. Some people who have type 2 diabetes need insulin therapy as well. In the past, insulin therapy was used as a last resort, but today it's often prescribed sooner because of its benefits. Because normal digestion interferes with insulin taken by mouth, insulin must be injected. Depending on your needs, your doctor may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use throughout the day and night. Often, people with type 2 diabetes start insulin use with one long-acting shot at night. Insulin injections involve using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen injector - a device that looks similar to an ink pen, except the cartridge is filled with insulin. There are many types of insulin, and they each work in a different way. Options include: - Insulin glulisine (Apidra) - Insulin lispro (Humalog) - Insulin aspart (Novolog) - Insulin glargine (Lantus) - Insulin detemir (Levemir) - Insulin isophane (Humulin N, Novolin N) Discuss the pros and cons of different drugs with your doctor. Together you can decide which medication is best for you after considering many factors, including costs and other aspects of your health. In addition to diabetes medications, your doctor might prescribe low-dose aspirin therapy as well as blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medications to help prevent heart and blood vessel disease. Bariatric surgery If you have type 2 diabetes and your body mass index (BMI) is greater than 35, you may be a candidate for weight-loss surgery (bariatric surgery). Blood sugar levels return to normal in 55 to 95 percent of people with diabetes, depending on the procedure performed. Surgeries that bypass a portion of the small intestine have more of an effect on blood sugar levels than do other weight-loss surgeries. Drawbacks to the surgery include its high cost, and there are risks involved, including a risk of death. Additionally, drastic lifestyle changes are required and long-term complications may include nutritional deficiencies and osteoporosis. Pregnancy Women with type 2 diabetes may need to alter their treatment during pregnancy. Many women will require insulin therapy during pregnancy. Cholesterol-lowering medications and some blood pressure drugs can't be used during pregnancy. If you have signs of diabetic retinopathy, it may worsen during pregnancy. Visit your ophthalmologist during the first trimester of your pregnancy and at one year postpartum. Signs of trouble Because so many factors can affect your blood sugar, problems sometimes arise that require immediate care, such as: - High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Your blood sugar level can rise for many reasons, including eating too much, being sick or not taking enough glucose-lowering medication. Check your blood sugar level often, and watch for signs and symptoms of high blood sugar - frequent urination, increased thirst, dry mouth, blurred vision, fatigue and nausea. If you have hyperglycemia, you'll need to adjust your meal plan, medications or both. - Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). Signs and symptoms of this life-threatening condition include a blood sugar reading higher than 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L), dry mouth, extreme thirst, fever greater than 101 F (38 C), drowsiness, confusion, vision loss, hallucinations and dark urine. Your blood sugar monitor may not be able to give you an exact reading at such high levels and may instead just read ""high."" HHNS is caused by sky-high blood sugar that turns blood thick and syrupy. It tends to be more common in older people with type 2 diabetes, and it's often preceded by an illness or infection. HHNS usually develops over days or weeks. Call your doctor or seek immediate medical care if you have signs or symptoms of this condition. - Increased ketones in your urine (diabetic ketoacidosis). If your cells are starved for energy, your body may begin to break down fat. This produces toxic acids known as ketones. Watch for thirst or a very dry mouth, frequent urination, vomiting, shortness of breath, fatigue and fruity-smelling breath. You can check your urine for excess ketones with an over-the-counter ketones test kit. If you have excess ketones in your urine, consult your doctor right away or seek emergency care. This condition is more common in people with type 1 diabetes but can sometimes occur in people with type 2 diabetes. - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). If your blood sugar level drops below your target range, it's known as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons, including skipping a meal, inadvertently taking more medication than usual or getting more physical activity than normal. Low blood sugar is most likely if you take glucose-lowering medications that promote the secretion of insulin or if you're taking insulin. Check your blood sugar level regularly, and watch for signs and symptoms of low blood sugar - sweating, shakiness, weakness, hunger, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, heart palpitations, slurred speech, drowsiness, confusion and seizures. If you develop hypoglycemia during the night, you might wake with sweat-soaked pajamas or a headache. Due to a natural rebound effect, nighttime hypoglycemia might cause an unusually high blood sugar reading first thing in the morning. If you have signs or symptoms of low blood sugar, drink or eat something that will quickly raise your blood sugar level - fruit juice, glucose tablets, hard candy, regular (not diet) soda or another source of sugar. Retest in 15 minutes to be sure your blood glucose levels have normalized. If they haven't, treat again and retest in another 15 minutes. If you lose consciousness, a family member or close contact may need to give you an emergency injection of glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the release of sugar into the blood. Careful management of type 2 diabetes can reduce your risk of serious - even life-threatening - complications. Consider these tips: - Commit to managing your diabetes. Learn all you can about type 2 diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Establish a relationship with a diabetes educator, and ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it. - Schedule a yearly physical exam and regular eye exams. Your regular diabetes checkups aren't meant to replace regular physicals or routine eye exams. During the physical, your doctor will look for any diabetes-related complications, as well as screen for other medical problems. Your eye care specialist will check for signs of retinal damage, cataracts and glaucoma. - Identify yourself. Wear a necklace or bracelet that says you have diabetes. - Keep your immunizations up to date. High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year, and your doctor will likely recommend the pneumonia vaccine, as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends the hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't previously received this vaccine and you're an adult age 19 to 59 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The CDC advises vaccination as soon as possible after diagnosis with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If you are age 60 or older, have diabetes and haven't previously received the vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you. - Take care of your teeth. Diabetes may leave you prone to more-serious gum infections. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, floss your teeth once a day and schedule regular dental exams. Consult your dentist right away if your gums bleed or look red or swollen. - Pay attention to your feet. Wash your feet daily in lukewarm water. Dry them gently, especially between the toes, and moisturize with lotion. Check your feet every day for blisters, cuts, sores, redness and swelling. Consult your doctor if you have a sore or other foot problem that isn't healing. - Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. Eating healthy foods and exercising regularly can go a long way toward controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol. Medication also may be needed. - If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your doctor to help you quit. Smoking increases your risk of various diabetes complications. Talk to your doctor about ways to stop smoking or to stop using other types of tobacco. - If you drink alcohol, do so responsibly. Alcohol, as well as drink mixers, can cause either high or low blood sugar, depending on how much you drink and if you eat at the same time. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation and always with a meal. The recommendation is no more than one drink daily for women, no more than two drinks daily for men age 65 and younger, and one drink a day for men over 65. If you're on insulin or other medications that lower your blood sugar, check your blood sugar before you go to sleep to make sure you're at a safe level. Numerous alternative medicine substances have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in some studies, while other studies fail to find any benefit for blood sugar control or in lowering A1C levels. Because of the conflicting findings, no alternative therapies are recommended to help with blood sugar management. If you decide to try an alternative therapy, don't stop taking the medications that your doctor has prescribed. Be sure to discuss the use of any of these therapies with your doctor to make sure that they won't cause adverse reactions or interact with your medications. No treatments - alternative or conventional - can cure diabetes. So it's critical that people who are using insulin therapy for diabetes don't stop using insulin unless directed to do so by their physicians.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193
71,72,SSPE. My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, disabling, and deadly brain disorder related to measles (rubeola) infection. The disease develops many years after the measles infection. Normally, the measles virus does not cause brain damage. But an abnormal immune response to measles or, possibly, certain mutant forms of the virus may cause severe illness and death. This response leads to brain inflammation (swelling and irritation) that may last for years. SSPE has been reported in all parts of the world, but in western countries it is a rare disease. Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally occurs in children and adolescents. Symptoms of SSPE occur in four general stages. With each stage, the symptoms are worse than the stage before: - Stage I: There may be personality changes, mood swings, or depression. Fever and headache may also be present. This stage may last up to 6 months. - Stage II: There may be uncontrolled movement problems including jerking and muscle spasms. Other symptoms that may occur in this stage are loss of vision, dementia, and seizures. - Stage III: Jerking movements are replaced by writhing (twisting) movements and rigidity. Death may occur from complications. - Stage IV: Areas of the brain that control breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure are damaged. This leads to coma and then death. There may be a history of measles in an unvaccinated child. A physical examination may reveal: - Damage to the optic nerve, which is responsible for sight - Damage to the retina, the part of the eye that receives light - Muscle twitching - Poor performance on motor (movement) coordination tests The following tests may be performed: - Electroencephalogram (EEG) - Brain MRI - Serum antibody titer to look for signs of previous measles infection - Spinal tap No cure for SSPE exists. However, certain antiviral drugs and drugs that boost the immune system may slow the progression of the disease. SSPE is always fatal. People with this disease die 1 to 3 years after diagnosis. Some people may survive longer. Call your health care provider if your child has not completed their scheduled vaccines. The measles vaccine is included in the MMR vaccine. Immunization against measles is the only known prevention for SSPE. The measles vaccine has been highly effective in reducing the numbers of affected children. Measles immunization should be done according to the recommended American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control schedule. Updated by: Amit M.

72,73,ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.. My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Tranaunay Syndrome...There is very little information about this. We are looking for the current research and treatments available. She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected. We want to get her help as soon as possible to address the symptoms and treat her condition.,"Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (Treatment): Although there's no cure for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, your doctor can help you manage symptoms and prevent complications. Because KTS may affect many systems in the body, your health care team may include specialists in vascular medicine and surgery, skin diseases (dermatology), interventional radiology, orthopedic surgery, physical therapy and rehabilitation, and other areas as needed. You and your doctor can work together to determine which of the following treatments are most appropriate for you. Treatments may include: - Compression therapy. Bandages or elastic garments are wrapped around affected limbs to help prevent swelling, problems with varicose veins and skin ulcers. These bandages or elastic garments often need to be custom-fit. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices - leg or arm sleeves that automatically inflate and deflate at set intervals - may be used. - Physical therapy. Massage, compression and limb movement as appropriate may help relieve lymphedema in arms or legs and swelling of the blood vessels. - Orthopedic devices. These may include orthopedic shoes or shoe inserts to compensate for differences in leg length. - Epiphysiodesis (ep-ih-fiz-e-OD-uh-sis). This is an orthopedic surgical procedure that effectively can stop length overgrowth of the lower limb. - Embolization. This procedure, performed through small catheters placed into the veins or arteries, blocks blood flow to certain blood vessels. - Laser therapy. This procedure may be used to lighten port-wine stains and to treat early blebs on the skin. - Laser or radiofrequency ablation of veins. This minimally invasive procedure is used to close off abnormal veins. - Sclerotherapy. A solution is injected into a vein, which creates scar tissue that helps close the vein. - Surgery. In some cases, surgical removal or reconstruction of affected veins, removal of excess tissue, and correction of the overgrowth of bone may be beneficial. - Medication. Early research indicates that a drug called sirolimus (Rapamune) may help to treat symptomatic complex vascular malformations, but it may have significant side effects and more studies are needed. In addition, treatment may be needed for complications such as bleeding, pain, infection, blood clots or skin ulcers.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klippel-trenaunay/symptoms-causes/syc-20374152
73,74,Iron Overdose. Um...i took 25 iron pills...what do i do...this was last night,"Iron overdose: Iron is a mineral found in many over-the-counter supplements. Iron overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this mineral. This can be by accident or on purpose. Iron overdose is especially dangerous for children. A severe overdose can happen if a child eats adult multivitamins, such as prenatal vitamins. If the child eats too many pediatric multivitamins, the effect is usually minor. This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Iron can be harmful in large amounts. Iron is an ingredient in many mineral and vitamin supplements. Iron supplements are also sold by themselves. Types include: - Ferrous sulfate (Feosol, Slow Fe) - Ferrous gluconate (Fergon) - Ferrous fumarate (Femiron, Feostat) Other products may also contain iron. Below are symptoms of an iron overdose in different parts of the body. AIRWAYS AND LUNGS - Buildup of fluids in the lungs STOMACH AND INTESTINES - Black, and possibly bloody stools - Diarrhea - Liver damage - Metallic taste in mouth - Nausea - Vomiting blood HEART AND BLOOD - Dehydration - Low blood pressure - Fast and weak pulse - Shock NERVOUS SYSTEM - Chills - Coma (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness, may occur within 1/2 hour to 1 hour after overdose) - Convulsions - Dizziness - Drowsiness - Fever - Headache - Lack of desire to do anything SKIN - Bluish-colored lips and fingernails - Flushing - Loss of color from the skin (pallor) Note: Symptoms may go away in a few hours, then return again after 1 day or later. Have this information ready: - Person's age, weight, and condition - Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) - Time it was swallowed - Amount swallowed - If the medicine was prescribed for the person Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible. The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: - Blood and urine tests, including tests to check iron levels - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator) - Camera and tube down the throat to see the esophagus and the stomach and remove pills or stop internal bleeding - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) - Fluids through a vein (by IV) - Medicine to help remove iron from the body and treat symptoms - Whole bowel irrigation with a special solution to quickly flush the iron through the stomach and intestines (taken by mouth or through a tube through the nose into the stomach) - X-ray to detect and track iron tablets through the stomach and intestines There is a good chance of recovery if the person's symptoms are gone 48 hours after the iron overdose. But, severe liver damage can occur 2 to 5 days after the overdose. Some people have died up to a week after an iron overdose. The more quickly the person receives treatment, the better the chance for survival. Iron overdose can be very severe in children. Children may sometimes eat large amounts of iron pills because they look like candy. Many manufacturers have changed their pills so they no longer look like candy. Updated by: Jacob L.

74,75,Inherited Ricketts. Mother has inherited ricketts. Passing A child but not B child. How likely would B child pass it on their child?,"Genetic counseling: Genetics is the study of heredity, the process of a parent passing certain genes on to their children. - A person's appearance, such as height, hair color, skin color, and eye color, are determined by genes. - Birth defects and certain diseases are also often determined by genes. Genetic counseling is the process where parents can learn more about: - How likely it will be that their child would have a genetic disorder - What tests can check for genetic defects or disorders - Deciding whether or not you would like to haven these tests Couples who want to have a baby can have tests before they get pregnant. Health care providers can also test a fetus (unborn baby) to see if the baby will have a genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis or Down syndrome. It is up to you whether or not to have genetic counseling and testing. You will want to think about your personal desires, religious beliefs, and family circumstances. Some people have a greater risk than others for passing on genetic disorders to their children. They are: - People who have family members or children with genetic or birth defects - Jews of Eastern European descent. They may have a high risk of having babies with Tay-Sachs or Canavan's disease. - African-Americans, who may risk passing sickle-cell anemia (blood disease) on to their children - People of Southeast Asian or Mediterranean origin, who are at a higher risk of having children with thalassemia, a blood disease - Women who were exposed to toxins (poisons) that could cause birth defects - Women with a health problem, such as diabetes, that may affect their fetus - Couples who have had three of more miscarriages (fetus dies before 20 weeks of pregnancy) Testing is also suggested for: - Women who are over the age of 35, though genetic screening is now recommended for women of all ages. - Women who have had abnormal results on pregnancy screening, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Talk about genetic counseling with your provider and your family. Ask questions you may have about the test and what the results will mean for you. Keep in mind that genetic tests that are done before you get pregnant (conceive) can most often only tell you the odds of having a child with a certain birth defect. For instance, you may learn that you and your partner have a 1 in 4 chance of having a child with a certain disease or defect. If you decide to conceive, you will need more tests to see if your baby will have the defect or not. For those who may be at risk, test results can help answer such questions as: - Are the chances of having a baby with a genetic defect so high that we should look at other ways to start a family? - If you have a baby with a genetic disorder, are there treatments or surgeries that can help the baby? - How do we prepare ourselves for the chance we might have a child with a genetic problem? Are there classes or support groups for the disorder? Are there providers nearby who treat children with the disorder? - Should we continue the pregnancy? Are the baby's problems so severe that we might choose to end the pregnancy? You can prepare by finding out if any medical problems like these run in your family: - Child development problems - Miscarriages - Stillbirth - Severe childhood illnesses Steps in genetic counseling include: - You will fill out an in-depth family history form and talk to the counselor about health problems that run in your family. - You may also get blood tests to look at your chromosomes or other genes. - Your family history and test results will help the counselor look at genetic defects you may pass on to your children. If you choose to be tested after you become pregnant, tests that may be done during the pregnancy (either on the mother or fetus) include: - Amniocentesis, in which fluid is withdrawn from the amniotic sac (fluid that surrounds the baby) - Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which takes a sample of the cells from the placenta - Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), which tests blood from the umbilical cord (the cord that connects the mother to the baby) - Noninvasive prenatal screening, which looks in the mother's blood for DNA from the baby that may have an extra or missing chromosome These tests have some risks. They may cause infection, harm the fetus, or cause a miscarriage. If you are worried about these risks, talk to your provider. The purpose of genetic counseling is simply to help parents make informed decisions. A genetic counselor will help you figure out how to use the information you get from your tests. If you are at risk, or if you find out that your baby has a disorder, your counselor and provider will talk to you about options and resources. But the decisions are yours to make.

My doctor has since given me a prescription to have massage therapy which she thought medicare would cover. However, when checking with medicare, it turns out that it does not! Can you suggest any other type of treatment?","Fibromyalgia (Treatment): In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780

What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"MTHFR gene variant (Summary): MTHFR is a gene . We all carry two copies of MTHFR. MTHFR tells our body how to create an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine. [1] [2] [3] As is true for any gene, the DNA code of the  MTHFR gene can vary. When we identify a part of the sequence that varies, we call it a ""variant."" Genetic research aims to identify specific variants that cause harm or benefit to health. There are two MTHFR gene variants, called C677T and A1298C, that have been an active area of study. These variants are common. In America, about 25% of people who are Hispanic, and 10-15% of people who are Caucasian have two copies of C677T. [4] Studies have found that women with two C677T gene variants have an increased risk for having a child with a neural tube defect. [4] Studies have also found that men and women with two C677T gene variants and elevated homocysteine levels may be at a mild increased risk for blood clots (venous thromboembolism).

77,78,"Vitamin D intake. Can high doses of Vitamin D (50,000 IUs per week) cause flatulence, among other possible effects? And is such a high dose safe to raise very low levels of Vitamin D in the body?","Vitamin D Deficiency (Summary): Summary What is vitamin D deficiency? Vitamin D deficiency means that you are not getting enough vitamin D to stay healthy. Why do I need vitamin D and how do I get it? Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. Vitamin D also has a role in your nervous, muscle, and immune systems. You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. But too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer, so many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources. How much vitamin D do I need? The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are - Birth to 12 months: 400 IU - Children 1-13 years: 600 IU - Teens 14-18 years: 600 IU - Adults 19-70 years: 600 IU - Adults 71 years and older: 800 IU - Pregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IU People at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more. Check with your health care provider about how much you need. What causes vitamin D deficiency? You can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons: - You don't get enough vitamin D in your diet - You don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem) - You don't get enough exposure to sunlight. - Your liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body. - You take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin D Who is at risk of vitamin D deficiency? Some people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency: - Breastfed infants, because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding, give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day. - Older adults, because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young, and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form. - People with dark skin, which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun. - People with disorders such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease who don't handle fat properly, because vitamin D needs fat to be absorbed. - People who are obese, because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood. - People who have had gastric bypass surgery - People with osteoporosis - People with chronic kidney or liver disease. - People with hyperparathyroidism (too much of a hormone that controls the body's calcium level) - People with sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or other granulomatous disease (disease with granulomas, collections of cells caused by chronic inflammation) - People with some lymphomas, a type of cancer. - People who take medicines that affect vitamin D metabolism, such as cholestyramine (a cholesterol drug), anti-seizure drugs, glucocorticoids, antifungal drugs, and HIV/AIDS medicines. Talk with your health care provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency. There is a blood test which can measure how much vitamin D is in your body. What problems does vitamin D deficiency cause? Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density, which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures. Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases. In children, it can cause rickets. Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets. In adults, severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones, bone pain, and muscle weakness. Researchers are studying vitamin D for its possible connections to several medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis. They need to do more research before they can understand the effects of vitamin D on these conditions. How can I get more vitamin D? There are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D: - Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel - Beef liver - Cheese - Mushrooms - Egg yolks You can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D include - Milk - Breakfast cereals - Orange juice - Other dairy products, such as yogurt - Soy drinks Vitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements, both in pills and a liquid for babies. If you have vitamin D deficiency, the treatment is with supplements. Check with your health care provider about how much you need to take, how often you need to take it, and how long you need to take it. Can too much vitamin D be harmful? Getting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys. Too much vitamin D also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Most cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.",#

Follow these guidelines for getting enough calcium and vitamin D: - Adults under age 50 should have 1,000 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 International Units (IU) of vitamin D a day. - Women ages 51 to 70 should have 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D a day. - Men ages 51 to 70 should have 1,000 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D a day. - Adults over age 70 should have 1,200 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D a day. - Your provider may recommend a calcium supplement. - Follow a diet that provides the proper amount of calcium and vitamin D. - Your provider may recommend higher doses of vitamin D if you have risk factors for osteoporosis or a low level of this vitamin. (Note: Some expert groups are not sure the benefits and safety of these amounts of vitamin D and calcium outweigh their risks. Be sure to discuss with your provider whether supplements are a good choice for you.) Stop unhealthy habits: - Quit smoking, if you smoke. - Limit your alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can damage your bones. This puts you at risk of falling and breaking a bone. It is important to prevent falls. These suggestions can help: - Do not take medicines that make you drowsy and unsteady. If you must take them, be extra careful when you are up and about. For example, hold on to countertops or sturdy furniture to avoid falling. - Remove household hazards, such as throw rugs, to reduce the risk of falls. - Leave lights on at night so you can see better when walking around your house. - Install and use safety grab bars in the bathroom. - Install antislip flooring in bathtubs and showers. - Make sure your vision is good. Have your eyes checked once or twice a year by an eye doctor. - Wear shoes that fit well and have low heels. This includes slippers. Slippers that do not have heels can cause you to trip and fall. - Do not walk outdoors alone on icy days. Surgery to treat severe, disabling pain from spinal fractures due to osteoporosis include: - Kyphoplasty (a material is placed into a bone of your spine to restore the height of the vertebrae) - Spinal fusion (bones of your spine are joined together so they do not move against each other)",https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000360.htm

I would like to know if you can point me in the direction of a laboratory in Southern California, Specifically San Bernardino County or LA County or even Riverside County that does genetic testing for EDS or Osteogenesis Imperfecta and do you know if the two diseases are similiar in symptoms? Thank you for you help and time.","Laboratory Tests (Summary): Summary Laboratory tests check a sample of your blood, urine, or body tissues. A technician or your doctor analyzes the test samples to see if your results fall within the normal range. The tests use a range because what is normal differs from person to person. Many factors affect test results. These include - Your sex, age and race - What you eat and drink - Medicines you take - How well you followed pre-test instructions Your doctor may also compare your results to results from previous tests. Laboratory tests are often part of a routine checkup to look for changes in your health. They also help doctors diagnose medical conditions, plan or evaluate treatments, and monitor diseases.",#

It took a year and a half of treatment (medicines, cauterization), but the symptoms do not stop inflammation and analyzes not determined that bacteria produce inflammation me. I wonder if, despite not being a sexual cervicitis infection, it can cause infertility. And that's what makes a tampon that causes inflammation. Thank you very much!","Cervicitis: Cervicitis is swelling or inflamed tissue of the end of the uterus (cervix). Cervicitis is most often caused by an infection that is caught during sexual activity. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can cause cervicitis include: - Chlamydia - Gonorrhea - Herpes virus (genital herpes) - Human papilloma virus (genital warts) - Trichomoniasis Other things that can cause cervicitis include: - A device inserted into the pelvic area such as a cervical cap, diaphragm, or pessary - Allergy to spermicides used for birth control - Allergy to latex in condoms - Exposure to a chemical Cervicitis is very common. It affects more than one half of all women at some point during their adult life. Risks include: - High-risk sexual behavior - History of STIs - Many sexual partners - Sex (intercourse) at an early age - Sexual partners who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI Bacteria (such as staphylococcus and streptococcus) and too much growth of normal bacteria in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) can also cause cervicitis. Symptoms include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding that occurs after intercourse, after menopause, or between periods - Unusual vaginal discharge that does not go away: discharge may be gray, white or yellow in color - Painful sexual intercourse - Pain in the vagina - Pressure or heaviness in the pelvis Note: There may be no symptoms. Women who may be at risk for chlamydia should be tested for this infection, even if they do not have symptoms. A pelvic exam is done to look for: - Discharge from the cervix - Redness of the cervix - Swelling (inflammation) of the walls of the vagina Tests that may be done include: - Inspection of the discharge under a microscope (may show candidiasis, trichomoniasis, or bacterial vaginosis) - Pap test - Tests for gonorrhea or chlamydia Rarely, colposcopy and biopsy of the cervix is necessary. Antibiotics are used to treat chlamydia or gonorrhea. Drugs called antivirals may be used to treat herpes infections. Hormonal therapy (with estrogen or progesterone) may be used in women who have reached menopause. When these treatments have not worked or when cervicitis has been present for a long time, treatment may include: - Cryosurgery (freezing) - A small probe with an electric current running through it is used to burn or destroy the tissue - Laser therapy Most of the time, simple cervicitis usually heals with treatment if the cause is found and there is a treatment for that cause. Cervicitis may last for months to years. Cervicitis may lead to pain with intercourse (dyspareunia). Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of cervicitis. Things you can do to reduce your risk of developing cervicitis include: - Avoid irritants such as douches and deodorant tampons. - Make sure that any foreign objects you insert into your vagina (such as tampons) are properly placed. Be sure to follow instructions on how long to leave it inside, how often to change it, or how often to clean it. - Make sure your partner is free of any STI. You and your partner should not have sex with any other people. - Use a condom every time you have sex to lower your risk of getting an STI. Condoms are available for both men and women, but are most commonly worn by the man. A condom must be used properly every time.

88,89,metformin. Does metformin cause high blood pressure?,"How to Prevent High Blood Pressure (Summary): Summary About 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. has high blood pressure, or hypertension, but many don't realize it. High blood pressure usually has no warning signs, yet it can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and simple, healthy changes can keep high blood pressure from seriously damaging your health. What is blood pressure? Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. How do I know if my blood pressure is high? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. For most adults, blood pressure readings will be in one of four categories: Normal blood pressure means - Your systolic pressure is less than 120 AND - Your diastolic pressure is less than 80 Prehypertension means - Your systolic pressure is between 120-139 OR - Your diastolic pressure is between 80-89 Stage 1 high blood pressure means - Your systolic pressure is between 140-159 OR - Your diastolic pressure is between 90-99 Stage 2 high blood pressure means - Your systolic pressure is 160 or higher OR - Your diastolic pressure is 100 or higher For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and gender. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80. Why do I need to worry about prehypertension and high blood pressure? Prehypertension means you're likely to end up with high blood pressure, unless you take steps to prevent it. When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure. What are the different types of high blood pressure? There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. - Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older. - Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat the cause or stop taking the medicines that are causing it. Who is at risk for high blood pressure? Anyone can develop high blood pressure, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk: - Age - Blood pressure tends to rise with age - Race/Ethnicity - High blood pressure is more common in African American adults - Weight - People who are overweight or obese are more likely to develop prehypertension or high blood pressure - Gender - Before age 55, men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop it. - Lifestyle - Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, such as eating too much sodium or not enough potassium, lack of exercise, drinking too much alcohol, and smoking. - Family history - A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing prehypertension or high blood pressure How can I prevent high blood pressure? You can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This means - Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat, and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure. - Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual. - Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. - Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one. - Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. - Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating. If you already have high blood pressure, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",#
89,90,aclidinium. is this a steroid? is there a problem using this if there is a possibility of the need for cataract surgery within the next 12 months?,"Cataract removal: Cataract removal is surgery to remove a clouded lens (cataract) from the eye. Cataracts are removed to help you see better. The procedure almost always includes placing an artificial lens (IOL) in the eye. Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure. This means you likely do not have to stay overnight at a hospital. The surgery is performed by an ophthalmologist. This is a medical doctor who specializes in eye diseases and eye surgery. Adults are usually awake for the procedure. Numbing medicine (local anesthesia) is given using eyedrops or a shot. This blocks pain. You will also get medicine to help you relax. Children usually receive general anesthesia. This makes them unconscious and unable to feel pain. The doctor uses a special microscope to view the eye. A small cut (incision) is made in the eye. The lens is removed in one of the following ways, depending on the type of cataract: - Phacoemulsification: With this procedure, the doctor uses a tool that produces sound waves to break up the cataract into small pieces. The pieces are then suctioned out. This procedure uses a very small incision. - Extracapsular extraction: The doctor uses a small tool to remove the cataract in mostly one piece. This procedure uses a larger incision. - Laser surgery: The doctor guides a machine that uses laser energy to make the incisions and soften the cataract. The rest of the surgery is much like phacoemulsification. Using the laser instead of a knife (scalpel) may speed recovery and be more accurate. After the cataract is removed, a manmade lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL), is usually placed into the eye to restore the focusing power of the lens (cataract). It helps improve your vision. The doctor may close the incision with very small stitches. Usually, a self-sealing (sutureless) method is used. If you have stitches, they may need to be removed later. The surgery lasts less than half an hour. Most times, just one eye is done. If you have cataracts in both eyes, your doctor may suggest waiting at least 1 to 2 weeks between each surgery. The normal lens of the eye is clear (transparent). As a cataract develops, the lens becomes cloudy. This blocks light from entering your eye. Without enough light, you cannot see as clearly. Cataracts are painless. They are most often seen in older adults. Sometimes, children are born with them. Cataract surgery is usually done if you cannot see well enough because of cataracts. Cataracts usually do not damage your eye, so you and your eye doctor can decide when surgery is right for you. In rare cases, the entire lens cannot be removed. If this happens, a procedure to remove all of the lens fragments will be done at a later time. Afterward, vision can still be improved. Very rare complications can include infection and bleeding. This can lead to permanent vision problems. Before surgery, you will have a complete eye exam and eye tests by the ophthalmologist. The doctor will use ultrasound or a laser scanning device to measure your eye. These tests help determine the best IOL for you. Usually, the doctor will try to choose an IOL that can allow you to see without glasses or contact lenses after surgery. Be sure you understand what your vision will be like after the IOL is implanted. Your doctor may prescribe eyedrops before the surgery. Follow instructions exactly on how to use the drops. Before you go home, you may receive the following: - A patch to wear over your eye until the follow-up exam - Eyedrops to prevent infection, treat inflammation, and help with healing You will need to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually have a follow-up exam with your doctor the next day. If you had stitches, you will need to make an appointment to have them removed. Tips for recovering after cataract surgery: - Wear dark sunglasses outside after you remove the patch. - Wash your hands well before and after using eyedrops and touching your eye. Try not to get soap and water in your eye when you are bathing or showering for the first few days. - Light activities are best as you recover. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving. Recovery takes about 2 weeks. If you need new glasses or contact lenses, you can usually have them fitted at that time. Keep your follow-up visit with your doctor. Most people do well and recover quickly after cataract surgery. If a person has other eye problems, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, the surgery may be more difficult or the outcome may not be as good. Updated by: Franklin W.

90,91,intestines digestion and sbsorption. kindly explain the general effects of smoking or rather the effects of nicotine to digestion and arbsoption,"Gastrointestinal perforation: Perforation is a hole that develops through the wall of a body organ. This problem may occur in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, or gallbladder. Perforation of an organ can be caused by a variety of factors. These include: - Appendicitis - Cancer - Crohn disease - Diverticulitis - Gallbladder disease - Peptic ulcer disease - Ulcerative colitis - Bowel blockage - Chemotherapy agents It may also be caused by surgery in the abdomen or procedures such as colonoscopy. Perforation of the intestine or other organs causes the contents to leak into the abdomen. This causes a severe infection called peritonitis. Symptoms may include: - Severe abdominal pain - Chills - Fever - Nausea - Vomiting X-rays of the chest or abdomen may show air in the abdominal cavity. This is called free air. It is a sign of a tear. A CT scan of the abdomen often shows where the hole is located. The white blood cell count is often higher than normal. Treatment most often involves emergency surgery to repair the hole. - Sometimes, a small part of the intestine must be removed. One end of the intestine may be brought out through an opening (stoma) made in the abdominal wall. This is called a colostomy or ileostomy. - A drain from the abdomen or other organ may also be needed. In rare cases, people can be treated with antibiotics alone if the perforation has closed. This can be confirmed by a physical exam, blood tests, CT scan, and x-rays. Surgery is successful most of the time. However, the outcome will depend on how severe the perforation is, and for how long it was present before treatment. The presence of other illnesses can also affect how well a person will do after treatment. Even with surgery, infection is the most common complication of the condition. Infections can be either inside the abdomen (abdominal abscess or peritonitis), or throughout the whole body. Body-wide infection is called sepsis. Sepsis can be very serious and can lead to death. Call your health care provider if you have: - Blood in your stool - Changes in bowel habits - Fever - Nausea - Severe abdominal pain - Vomiting People will often have a few days of pain before the intestinal perforation occurs. If you have pain in the abdomen, see your provider right away. Treatment is much simpler and safer when it is started before the perforation occurs. Updated by: Subodh K.

91,92,sswollen feet ankles legs I have fibromyalgia. When suffering from fibromyalgia will that cause swollen in your body . The swollen started yesterday,"Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia, or fibromyalgia syndrome, is a condition that causes aches and pain all over the body. People with fibromyalgia often experience other symptoms, such as extreme tiredness or sleeping, mood, or memory problems. Fibromyalgia affects more women than men. The pain, extreme tiredness, and lack of sleep that fibromyalgia causes can affect your ability to work or do daily activities. Treatment can help relieve pain and help prevent flare-ups of symptoms. Fibromyalgia is also called fibromyalgia syndrome. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that happen together. People with fibromyalgia experience aches and pain all over the body, fatigue (extreme tiredness that does not get better with sleep or rest), and problems sleeping. Fibromyalgia may be caused by a problem in the brain with nerves and pain signals. In other words, in people with fibromyalgia, the brain misunderstands everyday pain and other sensory experiences, making the person more sensitive to pressure, temperature (hot or cold), bright lights, and noise compared to people who do not have fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia has been compared to arthritis. Like arthritis, fibromyalgia causes pain and fatigue. But, unlike arthritis, fibromyalgia does not cause redness and swelling, or damage to your joints. Fibromyalgia affects as many as 4 million Americans 18 and older.1 The average age range at which fibromyalgia is diagnosed is 35 to 45 years old, but most people have had symptoms, including chronic pain, that started much earlier in life. Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men.1,2 Maybe. Fibromyalgia is more common in people who:1 Chronic (long-term), widespread pain is the most common symptom of fibromyalgia. You may feel the pain all over your body. Or, you may feel it more in the muscles you use most often, like in your back or legs. The pain may feel like a deep muscle ache, or it may throb or burn. Your pain may also be worse in the morning. Other symptoms of fibromyalgia include:3,4,5 Women with fibromyalgia often have more morning fatigue, pain all over the body, and IBS symptoms than men with fibromyalgia have.8 Fibromyalgia symptoms can happen without warning. But certain events may trigger flare-ups, including: Researchers are not sure exactly what causes fibromyalgia. Genetics may play a role. Studies also show that the brains of people with fibromyalgia may not process pain in the same way as people who do not have fibromyalgia. Lower levels of certain brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin or norepinephrine, may cause you to be more sensitive to pain and have a more severe reaction to pain. Imaging studies of the brain show that people with fibromyalgia feel pain when people without fibromyalgia do not.10 Some medicines prescribed to treat fibromyalgia try to bring the levels of those neurotransmitters back into balance. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and your medical history. There is no lab test for fibromyalgia. Instead, your doctor will make a diagnosis based upon two criteria: You may have to see several doctors before getting a diagnosis. One reason for this may be that pain and fatigue, the main symptoms of fibromyalgia, also are symptoms of many other conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Doctors try to figure out if fibromyalgia or another health problem is causing your symptoms. Treatment for fibromyalgia may include: Your doctor or nurse may also suggest taking steps at home to relieve your symptoms. You can take the following steps at home to help relieve your symptoms: Maybe. Fibromyalgia is a chronic disease that is often a lifelong condition. But fibromyalgia is not a progressive disease, meaning it will not get worse over time. It also does not cause damage to your joints, muscles, or organs. Taking steps to treat fibromyalgia can help relieve your symptoms. Many women with fibromyalgia have no problems getting pregnant, and some women report that their symptoms get better during pregnancy. But, for some women, fibromyalgia can cause problems during pregnancy. Your symptoms may flare or get worse, especially in the first few months of pregnancy. Also, some normal pregnancy complaints, such as fatigue, stress, and mood swings caused by changing hormones, may be worse for women with fibromyalgia. Talk to your doctor about any medicines you take to treat fibromyalgia, as they may cause other health problems for you or your unborn baby. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia are similar in many ways. A person can have fibromyalgia and ME/CFS. Both ME/CFS and fibromyalgia have pain and fatigue as symptoms. But the main symptom of fibromyalgia is pain, and the main symptom of ME/CFS is extreme tiredness that does not get better with sleep and rest, also called fatigue. Usually. Most people with fibromyalgia continue to work, but you may have to make changes to do so. You can cut down the number of hours you work, switch to a less demanding job, or adapt a current job. If you face challenges at work, an occupational therapist can help you design a more comfortable workstation or find more efficient and less painful ways to do your job. A number of federal laws protect your rights. However, if you cannot work because of your fibromyalgia, you may qualify for disability benefits through your employer or the Social Security Administration.

93,94,Plantar Fasiciitis. Is it true that more likely than not that Plantar fasiciitis could be aggravated by a consistancy of weight bearing activities? Are there other forms of aggravation? if so will you please inform me.,"Plantar fasciitis: Plantar fasciitis (PLAN-tur fas-e-I-tis) is one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes (plantar fascia). Plantar fasciitis commonly causes stabbing pain that usually occurs with your first steps in the morning. As you get up and move more, the pain normally decreases, but it might return after long periods of standing or after rising from sitting. Plantar fasciitis is more common in runners. In addition, people who are overweight and those who wear shoes with inadequate support have an increased risk of plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis typically causes a stabbing pain in the bottom of your foot near the heel. The pain is usually the worst with the first few steps after awakening, although it can also be triggered by long periods of standing or rising from sitting. The pain is usually worse after exercise, not during it. Under normal circumstances, your plantar fascia acts like a shock-absorbing bowstring, supporting the arch in your foot. If tension and stress on that bowstring become too great, small tears can arise in the fascia. Repetitive stretching and tearing can cause the fascia to become irritated or inflamed, though in many cases of plantar fasciitis, the cause isn't clear. Though plantar fasciitis can arise without an obvious cause, factors that can increase your risk of developing plantar fasciitis include: - Age. Plantar fasciitis is most common between the ages of 40 and 60. - Certain types of exercise. Activities that place a lot of stress on your heel and attached tissue - such as long-distance running, ballistic jumping activities, ballet dancing and aerobic dance - can contribute to an earlier onset of plantar fasciitis. - Foot mechanics. Being flat-footed, having a high arch or even having an abnormal pattern of walking can affect the way weight is distributed when you're standing and put added stress on the plantar fascia. - Obesity. Excess pounds put extra stress on your plantar fascia. - Occupations that keep you on your feet. Factory workers, teachers and others who spend most of their work hours walking or standing on hard surfaces can damage their plantar fascia. The diagnosis is made based on the medical history and physical examination. During the exam, your doctor will check for areas of tenderness in your foot. Where your pain is situated can help determine its cause. Imaging tests Usually no tests are necessary. Your doctor might suggest an X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to make sure your pain isn't being caused by another problem, such as a stress fracture or a pinched nerve. Sometimes an X-ray shows a spur of bone projecting forward from the heel bone. In the past, these bone spurs were often blamed for heel pain and removed surgically. But many people who have bone spurs on their heels have no heel pain. Most people who have plantar fasciitis recover with conservative treatments, including resting, icing the painful area and stretching, in several months. Medications Pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) can ease the pain and inflammation associated with plantar fasciitis. Therapies Stretching and strengthening exercises or use of specialized devices may provide symptom relief. These include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can instruct you in a series of exercises to stretch the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon and to strengthen lower leg muscles, which stabilize your ankle and heel. A therapist might also teach you to apply athletic taping to support the bottom of your foot. - Night splints. Your physical therapist or doctor might recommend that you wear a splint that stretches your calf and the arch of your foot while you sleep. This holds the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon in a lengthened position overnight and facilitates stretching. - Orthotics. Your doctor might prescribe off-the-shelf or custom-fitted arch supports (orthotics) to help distribute pressure to your feet more evenly. Surgical or other procedures When more-conservative measures aren't working after several months, your doctor might recommend: - Injections. Injecting a type of steroid medication into the tender area can provide temporary pain relief. Multiple injections aren't recommended because they can weaken your plantar fascia and possibly cause it to rupture. More recently, platelet-rich plasma has been used, under ultrasound guidance, to provide pain relief with less risk of tissue rupture. - Extracorporeal shock wave therapy. In this procedure, sound waves are directed at the area of heel pain to stimulate healing. It's usually used for chronic plantar fasciitis that hasn't responded to more-conservative treatments. This procedure might cause bruising, swelling, pain, numbness or tingling. Some studies show promising results, but it hasn't been shown to be consistently effective. - Tenex procedure. This minimally invasive procedure removes the scar tissue of plantar fasciitis without surgery. - Surgery. Few people need surgery to detach the plantar fascia from the heel bone. It's generally an option only when the pain is severe and all else fails. Side effects include a weakening of the arch in your foot. To reduce the pain of plantar fasciitis, try these self-care tips: - Maintain a healthy weight. Lose weight if you're overweight or obese to minimize stress on your plantar fascia. - Choose supportive shoes. Avoid high heels. Buy shoes with a low to moderate heel, good arch support and shock absorbency. Don't go barefoot, especially on hard surfaces. - Don't wear worn-out athletic shoes. Replace your old athletic shoes before they stop supporting and cushioning your feet. If you're a runner, buy new shoes after about 400 to 500 miles of use. - Change your sport. Try a low-impact sport, such as swimming or bicycling, instead of walking or jogging. - Apply ice. Hold a cloth-covered ice pack over the area of pain for 15 to 20 minutes three or four times a day or after activity. Or try ice massage. Freeze a water-filled paper cup and roll it over the site of discomfort for about five to seven minutes. Regular ice massage can help reduce pain and inflammation. - Stretch your arches. Simple home exercises can stretch your plantar fascia, Achilles tendon and calf muscles.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354846

It is also called a myocardial infarction (MI). Watch this video about: Coronary artery disease Angina is pain or pressure in the chest. It occurs when your heart muscle is not getting enough blood or oxygen. You may feel angina in your neck or jaw. Sometimes you may notice that you are short of breath.

96,97,ischemic syncope stroke diagonses. define?,"Syncope: Syncope is a medical term used to describe a temporary loss of consciousness due to the sudden decline of blood flow to the brain. Syncope is commonly called fainting or “passing out.” If an individual is about to faint, he or she will feel dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseous and their field of vision may “white out” or “black out.”  The skin may be cold and clammy.  The person drops to the floor as he or she loses consciousness.  After fainting, an individual may be unconscious for a minute or two, but will revive and slowly return to normal.  Syncope can occur in otherwise healthy people and affects all age groups, but occurs more often in the elderly.  There are several types of syncope.  Vasovagal syncope usually has an easily identified triggering event such as emotional stress, trauma, pain, the sight of blood, or prolonged standing.  Carotid sinus syncope happens because of constriction of the carotid artery in the neck and can occur after turning the head, while shaving, or when wearing a tight collar.  Situational syncope happens during urination, defecation, coughing, or as a result of gastrointestinal stimulation.  Syncope can also be a symptom of heart disease or abnormalities that create an uneven heart rate or rhythm that temporarily affect blood volume and its distribution in the body.  Syncope isn’t normally a primary sign of a neurological disorder, but it may indicate an increased risk for neurologic disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), diabetic neuropathy, and other types of neuropathy.  Certain classes of drugs are associated with an increased risk of syncope, including diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, antipsychotics, antihistamines, levodopa, narcotics, and alcohol. The immediate treatment for an individual who has fainted involves checking first to see if their airway is open and they are breathing.  The person should remain lying down for at least 10-15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet space.  If this isn’t possible, have the individual sit forward and lower their head below their shoulders and between their knees.  Ice or cold water in a cup is refreshing.  For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting.   At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.  If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease. Syncope is a dramatic event and can be life-threatening if not treated properly. Generally, however, people recover completely within minutes to hours.  If syncope is symptomatic of an underlying condition, then the prognosis will reflect the course of the disorder.",https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Fainting-Information-Page

IS IT USEABLE FOR MUSLIMS?,"Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (Treatment): Ptosis caused by chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) can be corrected by surgery, or by using glasses that have a “ptosis crutch” to lift the upper eyelids. [4] Strabismus surgery can be helpful in carefully selected patients if diplopia (double vision) occurs. [5] Some individuals with a deficiency of coenzyme Q10 have CPEO as an associated abnormality. Coenzyme Q10 is important for normal mitochondrial function. In individuals with this deficiency, supplemental coenzyme Q10 has been found to improve general neurologic function and exercise tolerance. However, coenzyme Q10 has not been shown to improve the ophthalmoplegia or ptosis in people who have isolated CPEO.

What doctor specializes in testing for and treatment of autoimmune illness?,"Autoimmune hepatitis (Treatment): Some people with mild forms of autoimmune hepatitis may not need to take medication. Doctors assess each patient individually to determine whether those with mild autoimmune hepatitis should undergo treatment. [1] Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. With proper treatment, autoimmune hepatitis can usually be controlled. In fact, studies show that sustained response to treatment stops the disease from getting worse and may reverse some of the damage. [1] The primary treatment is medicine to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system . [1]  Prednisone or other corticosteroids help reduce the inflammation. [1] [2] Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are drugs used to treat other autoimmune disorders, which have shown to help patients with autoimmune hepatitis as well. [2] In about seven out of 10 people, the disease goes into remission within 3 years of starting treatment. Remission occurs when symptoms disappear and lab tests show improvement in liver function. Some people can eventually stop treatment, although many will see the disease return. People who stop treatment must carefully monitor their condition and promptly report any new symptoms to their doctor. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for years, if not for life. [1] People who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenylate mofetil, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus. People who progress to end-stage liver disease—also called liver failure—or cirrhosis may need a liver transplant. Transplantation has a 1-year survival rate of 90 percent and a 5-year survival rate of 70 to 80 percent. [1]",https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5871/autoimmune-hepatitis

101,102,General health. i want to know more about aeortic stenosis,"General anesthesia: General anesthesia is treatment with certain medicines that puts you into a deep sleep so you do not feel pain during surgery. After you receive these medicines, you will not be aware of what is happening around you. Most times, a doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you the anesthesia. Sometimes, a certified and registered nurse anesthetist will take care of you. The medicine is given into your vein. You may be asked to breathe in (inhale) a special gas through a mask. Once you are asleep, the doctor may insert a tube into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe and protect your lungs. You will be watched very closely while you are asleep. Your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing will be monitored. The health care provider taking care of you can change how deeply asleep you are during the surgery. You will not move, feel any pain, or have any memory of the procedure because of this medicine. General anesthesia is a safe way to stay asleep and pain-free during procedures that would: - Be too painful - Take a long time - Affect your ability to breathe - Make you uncomfortable - Cause too much anxiety You may also be able to have conscious sedation for your procedure. Sometimes, though, it is not enough to make you comfortable. Children may need general anesthesia for a medical or dental procedure to handle any pain or anxiety they may feel. General anesthesia is usually safe for healthy people. You may have a higher risk of problems with general anesthesia if you: - Abuse alcohol or medicines - Have allergies or a family history of being allergic to medicines - Have heart, lung, or kidney problems - Smoke Ask your doctor about these complications: - Death (rare) - Harm to your vocal cords - Heart attack - Lung infection - Mental confusion (temporary) - Stroke - Trauma to the teeth or tongue - Waking during anesthesia (rare) - Allergy to the drugs - Malignant hyperthermia (fast rise in body temperature and severe muscle contractions) Tell your provider: - If you could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the surgery: - An anesthesiologist will take a complete medical history to determine the type and amount of the anesthesia you need. This includes asking you about any allergies, health conditions, medicines, and history of anesthesia. - Several days to a week before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking blood thinning drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven). - Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. - Always try to stop smoking. Your doctor can help. On the day of your surgery: - You will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery. This is to prevent you from vomiting while you are under the effect of the anesthesia. Vomiting can cause food in the stomach to be inhaled into the lungs. This can lead to breathing problems. - Take the drugs that your provider told you to take with a small sip of water. - Arrive at the hospital on time. You will wake up tired and groggy in the recovery or operating room. You may also feel sick to your stomach, and have a dry mouth, sore throat, or feel cold or restless until the effect of the anesthesia wears off. Your nurse will monitor these side effects, which will wear off, but it may take a few hours. Sometimes, nausea and vomiting can be treated with other medicines. Follow your surgeon's instructions while you recover and care for your surgical wound. General anesthesia is generally safe because of modern equipment, medicines, and safety standards. Most people recover completely and do not have any complications. Updated by: Mary C.

103,104,"Glimepiride Storage & Alloweable Excursion Data. Can you please provide Glimepiride storage & allowable temperature excursion data, specifically for pharmacy and warehouse storage","APRT gene: The APRT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT). This enzyme is produced in all cells and is part of the purine salvage pathway, which recycles a group of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called purines to make other molecules. The APRT enzyme helps to recycle the purine adenine to make a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This conversion occurs when AMP is needed as a source of energy for cells. At least 40 mutations in the APRT gene have been found to cause adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency, a condition that affects the kidneys and urinary tract. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the APRT enzyme. The mutations that cause APRT deficiency are categorized into two groups known as the APRT*J allele and the APRT*Q0 allele. The APRT*J allele consists of one mutation that replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid threonine at position 136 in the APRT enzyme (written as Met136Thr or M136T). This mutation reduces the function of the enzyme. The M136T mutation occurs almost exclusively in Japanese individuals with the condition; most affected individuals have this mutation on both copies of the APRT gene in each cell. The APRT*Q0 allele consists of all other APRT gene mutations. The most common of these mutations (written IVS4+2insT) alters the genetic instructions used to make the enzyme, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional enzyme. This mutation is estimated to occur in 40 percent of affected Europeans. APRT gene mutations lead to a lack of functional enzyme that prevents the conversion of adenine to AMP. As a result, adenine is converted to another molecule called 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA). 2,8-DHA crystallizes in urine, forming stones in the kidneys and urinary tract. As a result, kidney function can decline, which may lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening failure of kidney function.
