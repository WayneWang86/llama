DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female who presented to the Emergency Room with acute onset
of shortness of breath.  The patient had been at her nursing
home prior to this and developed respiratory distress with an
oxygen saturation of 73% on room air which improved to 82% on
non-rebreather with an elevated blood pressure of 210/120.
She was given 40 mg IV Lasix and Nitroglycerin on transfer
with some improvement.  The patient is a poor historian
because of her chronic schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease,
but she apparently denied chest pain and stated that her
shortness of breath improved with Lasix and diuresis.

In the Emergency Department her chest x-ray was consistent
with congestive heart failure.  She had a white blood cell
count of 19.  She had acute renal failure with a creatinine
of 3.0.  Hematocrit had fallen to 25.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes mellitus.  2.
Schizophrenia.  3.  Hypertension.  4.  Congestive heart
failure.  5.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction.  6.  Parkinsonism.  7.  Anxiety and depression.
8.  Alzheimer's disease.  9.  Tardive diskinesia.

ALLERGIES:  ALLOPURINOL AND MACRODANTIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nursing home resident.  Her
healthcare proxy is her daughter [**Name (NI) 106037**], phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 106038**].
SHE IS FULL CODE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 86, blood pressure
182/71, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 100% on 5 L.
General:  She was alert and oriented to name only.  She was
in mild respiratory distress.  She has severe tardive
diskinesia with frequent lip smacking.  HEENT:  Oropharynx
clear.  Neck:  Supple.  JVP approximately 11 cm.  Chest:
Rales approximately half way up with more prominence on the
right than on the left.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac.
Regular, rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 normal.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Mildly obese.  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
pedal edema.  She had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Rectal:
Heme negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission showed a urinalysis with
moderate blood, greater than 300 protein, leukocyte esterase
positive, 11-20 WBCs.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per
minute.  She had a normal axis with occasional PVCs.  She had
old significant Q-wave in lead III with poor R-wave
progression and T-wave inversions in V6.

Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrate, right
greater than left.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient
was aggressively diuresed with progressive improvement in her
respiratory failure.  There was some difficulty controlling
her blood pressure initially, but once she had good blood
pressure control, her response to treatment was greatly
augmented.  She was taken off of the ACE inhibitor because of
acute renal failure and placed on a nitrate Hydralazine
regimen instead.

Cardiac echocardiogram was performed and showed diffuse left
ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis with an ejection
fraction of approximately 25% without significant valvular
disease.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient ruled out by
enzymes initially.  She had exercise MIBI test performed
which showed large anterior wall with non-reversible
perfusion defect, a smaller apical irreversible defect, and a
moderate sized inferior wall non-reversible defect again with
an ejection fraction of approximately 25%.  The extensive
nature of her disease was discussed with the family, and
given the high risk of coronary catheterization with the risk
of ............... to her kidneys and the uncertain benefit
the patient would derive from coronary artery bypass
procedure, it was decided to treat the patient medically.

2.  Acute renal failure:  The patient appeared to have some
component of chronic renal insufficiency at baseline with a
baseline creatinine of around 1.9.  With diuresis and careful
titration of her medications, her creatinine progressively
improved during her hospitalization stay after peaking at
about 3.4 down to a level of 2.4 on the day prior to
discharge.  Her GFR should be calculated to be approximately
20 ml/min given her age, and all medicine should be dosed
appropriately.  The patient should be on a renal diet and
continue on TUMS for phosphate binding.  She should follow-up
with a nephrologist as an outpatient for further management
of her renal disease which is most likely secondary to her
diabetes and hypertension.


3.  Diabetes mellitus:  Her blood sugars were well controlled
in the hospital, and the patient should continue on her
standing regimen of NPH with regular Insulin sliding scale
supplementation.

4.  Urinary tract infection:  The patient had a urinalysis
that appeared to be positive for urinary tract infection;
however, urine cultures showed mixed flora consistent with
fecal contamination.  We will treat the patient empirically
with a 10-day course of Levofloxacin.

5.  Anemia:  The patient appeared to have chronic anemia with
a baseline hematocrit of approximately 25.  She was heme
negative on numerous analyses.  ................... labs were
all negative, and iron studies showed adequate levels.  She
was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells during her stay
and started on Erythropoietin, as her anemia is most likely
due to her chronic renal insufficiency.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d., Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d., Epogen 3000 U subcue 2 times per week, Amlodipine
2.5 mg p.o. q.d., Hydralazine 40 mg p.o. q.i.d., TUMS 1 g
p.o. q.d., Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d., Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
every other day, Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. every other day
until [**2-29**], Dipivefrin 0.1% O.U. b.i.d., Propine 0.1%
O.U. GTT b.i.d., Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d., Tylenol 650 mg
p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. q.d., NPH Insulin
32 U subcue in the morning, 8 U subcue in the evening,
Amiodarone 250 mg p.o. q.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

DIET:  Renal.  The patient had a positive video swallow study
for aspiration during her stay, so her diet should be pureed
with honey-thick liquids.  She should be positioned
................. upright and closely monitored for signs and
symptoms of aspiration.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To her chronic care facility.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  With her regular primary care physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. ................ who should feel free to set up an
outpatient evaluation with a nephrologist of his choice.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
25%.
2.  Coronary artery disease with fixed defects.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.

STAT DISCHARGE ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**], as stated in previous discharge
summary, was admitted on [**2168-2-25**] with respiratory distress,
treated initially but unsuccessfully with diuresis.  The patient
was noted to have increasing renal failure with creatinine rising
to 4.8.  The patient was seen by renal service and felt to have
ATN.  On [**2168-3-11**], the patient had episode of respiratory
distress and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for emergent intubation.  She was dialyzed that day and
transferred back to the floor on [**2168-3-15**].  Since transfer,
issues have been the following:

currently on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  Her renal
function has not improved and her urine output is minimal.
The renal service believes that kidney function may still improve
and thus ACE inhibitors have been held.  She has been treated
with Tums for hyperphosphatemia.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] does occasionally have
increasing oxygen requirement secondary to fluid overload.
However, she is unresponsive to Lasix and does well with
dialysis.  ACE inhibitor was held, but hydralazine and Isordil
were restarted and titrated up slowly.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] has a history of atrial
fibrillation on amiodarone.  She was anticoagulated with
Coumadin, but Coumadin was held on [**2168-3-19**] and [**2168-3-20**] for
super-therapeutic INR.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] does have occasional
leukocytosis with a white cell count of 20 without left shift.
She had been started on levofloxacin and Flagyl on [**2168-3-11**] for
aspiration pneumonia.  She completed a 10 day course for this.
She was also started on vancomycin on [**2168-3-13**] for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum.  She will need
to continue this until a 14 day course is completed.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was placed on NPH 6 mg subcutaneous
[**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale insulin at transfer.  However, on [**2168-3-19**],
blood sugars were noted to be up in the 500s which were
unresponsive to sliding scale insulin.  On [**2168-3-20**], she was
started on an insulin drip with good results.  NPH was increased
to 20 units in the morning and 15 units at night with good
results.  She has been off insulin since the nighttime.

6.  NEUROLOGIC:  On [**2168-3-19**], Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] was noted to have
seizure activity, including lateral gaze bilaterally to the left
and seizure activity of the left eye and mouth.  This continued
for almost one and a half hours with occasional breaks in
seasonal activity with return to baseline in between.  She was
given a total of 10 mg intravenous Valium and loaded on
intravenous phenytoin.  She will need to continue phenytoin for
at least one week.  Neurology was consulted and thought this was
likely secondary to toxic metabolic fluids from renal dialysis
versus hyperglycemia.  Meningitis cannot be ruled out at that
time.  LP was considered but it was unlikely that bacterial
meningitis was present, as she had been on broad spectrum
antibiotics for some time, and had no further seizure activity.
CT of the head was also obtained which showed old right frontal
cerebrovascular accident and enlarged ventricles, which could
have served as a seizure focus.

7.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  As stated in previous discharge summary,
Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] had coffee ground emesis from nasogastric tube on
[**2168-3-11**], but had no further episodes.  She will need
gastrointestinal evaluation at a later time.

CODE STATUS:  Full code

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to her
nursing home.

Admission Date:  [**2178-7-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-7-4**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a history of hypertension who presented from an
outside hospital with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction in
the inferior and posterior segments.

The patient had multiple episodes of nausea, chest pressure,
chest discomfort, and epigastric pain over the past two weeks
prior to admission.  Each episode lasted approximately one
hour.  The pain and episodes were stuttering in duration and
progression.  The pain radiated to her back and neck and was
associated with shortness of breath.  The patient also had
shortness of breath at rest.

She presented to an outside hospital where her
electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block
with ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF; ST depressions
in leads I, aVL, V2 through V6.  She was placed on aspirin,
heparin, nitroglycerin, Lopressor, and Integrilin with near
resolution of anginal symptoms.

The patient was then transferred via helicopter to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for emergent catheterization.
An interventional heart catheterization was performed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] which demonstrated a right-dominant coronary
circulation with left main coronary artery with a 30% tubular
ostial calcification, left anterior descending artery 70%
proximal lesion, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30272**] diseased first diagonal, left
circumflex with 99% long stenosis involving the
origin/proximal portion of first obtuse marginal which filled
retrograde by left-to-left collaterals; likely very chronic
but contributory to anterolateral ST depressions noted on
electrocardiograms prior to transfer.  The right coronary
artery with initial TIMI-II flow, sequential 90% tubular then
90% ulcerated hazy lesions just before short posterior
descending artery (with 90% ostial) and large posterior left
ventricular branches.  Post Angio-Jet predilation 3 balloon,
Lopressor, and deployment of 3.5 X 33 Hepakote [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 30272**]
posterior descending artery jailed and lost, unable to engage
with base, right coronary artery 0% residual stenosis,
TIMI-III flow.

While transferring the patient to the stretcher status post
catheterization, the patient was given a tablet of Plavix and
became extraordinarily anxious upon attempting to swallow the
pill.  She then raised her heart rate to the 140s.  Her blood
pressure went to 240/130, and the patient went into flash
pulmonary edema.  She was given Lasix 40 mg intravenously
times two and a nitroglycerin 200-mcg bolus followed by a
nitroglycerin drip at 250 mcg/kg per minute.  She was also
Fentanyl 25 mcg for anxiety.  She also reported wheezing
after being given a beta blocker.  At that time, the
patient's blood pressure was at 189/101, and she was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
at the time of admission revealed heart rate was 122, blood
pressure was 189/101, respiratory rate was 20, and the
patient was saturating at 89% on 100% nonrebreather mask.  In
general, an elderly female producing pink frothy sputum,
mildly uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  On neck examination, unable to assess
jugular venous pulsation.  The lungs revealed rales all the
way bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, clicks, or
gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis, and radial  pulses were
2+ bilaterally.  No presacral or lower extremity edema.  The
right groin catheterization site was without hematoma or
bruits.  It was clean, dry, and intact.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Moved
all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 119,
bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine
was 1, and blood glucose was 122.  Initial INR was 1.3.
Blood gas revealed 7.37/34/71.  Creatine kinase was [**2118**].

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital showed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads
II, III, and aVF with 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1
through V6 (these were dynamic changes).

At [**Hospital1 69**], she had a normal
sinus rhythm with a prolonged P-R interval with normal axis.
Status post catheterization with a left axis deviation, still
with 0.5-mm ST elevations inferiorly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2178-7-2**], the patient was on
aspirin, Lipitor, morphine, heparin, Integrilin, and
nitroglycerin drip.

She was asymptomatic with no nausea, chest pain, chest
pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema.  Her
lung examination was markedly improved on her second hospital
day with crackles halfway up.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**7-2**] which showed an
ejection fraction of 50%.  No aortic stenosis.  Mitral
regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.  No
effusions.  The left atrium was mildly dilated with inferior
wall motion abnormalities.

A chest x-ray from early on [**7-3**] showed likely congestive
heart failure with a tortuous aorta, small pleural effusions
(left greater than right), with pulmonary edema.

There was a discussion on [**7-2**] regarding taking the
patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory for treatment
of her left-sided disease.  However, it was decided that at
this time the culprit lesion was indeed the right coronary
artery, and the left-sided lesions would possibly be
corrected at a later date.

On [**7-3**], the patient was placed on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
twice per day and given some as needed medications for her
gas/bloating.  She did have two brief hypotensive episodes to
a systolic blood pressure of 90 which quickly corrected with
250-cc boluses times two.  Her creatine kinases trended down
nicely from 3092 to 2199 to 1456.  Her MB fractions also
trended down from 401 to 221 to 110.

On [**2178-7-4**], the patient was changed from atorvastatin
to fluvastatin because of a recent study indicating a
mortality benefit from fluvastatin as opposed to atorvastatin
when combined with Plavix.

On [**7-4**], the patient was also started on lisinopril 5 mg
p.o. every day and changed to Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. once per
day.  A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained which
showed the patient fully able to ambulate without becoming
symptomatic.  Her Foley catheter was discontinued.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in good
condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was informed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] (a
cardiologist in [**Location (un) 47**]) within the next week (telephone

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   She was sent home with the support
of her daughter ([**Name (NI) 501**] [**Name (NI) **]) and given handouts on her
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute ST elevation inferoposterior
myocardial infarction. Congestive heart failure, systolic and
diastolic acute on chronic.  Coronary artery disease.
Hypertension.  Hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:

Service:

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Transfer from an outside hospital for
chest pain/pressure presumed to be acute myocardial
infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease, status post acute
myocardial infarction the week prior to admission.  The
patient was taken to the cath laboratory the week prior and
found to have three vessel disease with a significant right
coronary artery stenosis of 90%.  She received a thrombectomy
and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with a
[**Age over 90 **] in the distal right coronary artery.  The other
significant disease was a 30% left main coronary artery and a
70% proximal left anterior descending, as well as left
circumflex 99% lesion were not intervened upon at that time.
On her last hospital admission, she was found by
echocardiogram to have an ejection fraction of 50% with 2+
mitral regurgitation and inferolateral akinesis.

On the day of admission, [**2178-7-6**], the patient presented
to an outside hospital Emergency Room complaining of
""abdominal tightness"" and  pain between the shoulder blades,
similar to the symptoms that brought her to the [**Hospital1 **] hospital the week prior.  An electrocardiogram
showed ST elevations in the posterolateral leads.  Integrilin
was started and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for emergency percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty.

Catheterization findings: Hemodynamics:  Initial normal-low
PA pressure, intermittent marked elevation with reflected V
wave.  At conclusion of case, PA pressure was 22/12.

coronary artery normal.  Left anterior descending:  70%.
Left circumflex artery:  99% long occlusion from AV groove,
left circumflex into marginal, supplying lateral wall and
papillary muscle.  Some collaterals from right to left.
Right coronary artery:  Patent stented right coronary artery.
Small diseased posterior descending artery.  TIMI three flow.
Intervention:  Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stenting of the proximal circumflex to distal
OM1 was performed using five overlapping 2.5 mm stents for a
total [**Hospital6 **] length of approximately 80 mm.  Left femoral
arteriotomy closure was performed using angioseal.  The
patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit for observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

q.p.m.  Lisinopril was started at 5 mg after creatinine came
back at 1.1.  The patient was asymptomatic, but did complain
of occasional dyspepsia.  The hematocrit after one unit of
packed red blood cells was at 26.9.  The patient was
transfused an additional two units of packed red blood cells
which brought her hematocrit to 34.3.  A chest x-ray was
obtained the previous day which showed a small bilateral
pleural effusions.

An echocardiogram was obtained which showed:
1.  The left ventricular cavity size as normal.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess, but is
probably normal (left ventricular ejection fraction greater
than 55%).
2.  There is a pericardial effusion.  The valves were not
well visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to cardiac cath on [**2125-8-3**]
showed three vessel CAD. The left main stent was widely patent.
The LAD
was chronically occluded proximally. The left circumflex stent
was
widely patent. The large lower pole of the OM1 was totally
occluded by
thrombus. The RCA had 60% proximal ISR which appeared unchanged
from
one year ago. The RCA was chronically totally occluded distally
and
appeared unchanged. The SVG-LAD was known to be occluded and was
not
injected. Successful PTCA/stenting of the large OM1 (lower
pole).

Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated filling
pressures
and low cardiac output, conistent with cardiogenic shock. Mean
RA
pressure was 16 mm Hg and mean PCW pressure was 37 mm Hg.
Moderate
pulmonary hypertension was present.

An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and patinet observed in
CCU. He was weaned off balloon pump within 24 hours.He initially
required dobutamine but was weaned on [**8-6**]. He was subsequently
transferred to the floor with stable vitals.He was continued on
ASA, plavix, statin, ACEI and lipitor

2. CHF

Admission Date:  [**2119-10-18**]       Discharge Date: [**2119-11-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2050-1-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Fernard Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
female with no significant past medical history who presented
to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with acute onset of respiratory
distress.  The patient had been noticing an enlarging neck
mass for the past three to four years.  As [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital notes, the patient noticed increasing phlegm
production two days prior to admission and increasing
shortness of breath.  She was being evaluated by
Otorhinolaryngology as an outpatient and sent to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital for head/neck/chest computerized tomography scan.
While in the Waiting Room the patient had an acute onset of
respiratory distress requiring intubation and was admitted to
the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital Intensive Care Unit.  Because the
outside hospital was unable to provide radiation, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**].

100 cc of necrotic material was aspirated from the left neck
mass which by report is consistent with squamous cell
carcinoma.  Computerized tomography scan of the neck/chest
revealed a 7 by 7 cm left-sided neck mass with deviation of
the trachea to the right and compression of the trachea
around the endotracheal tube.  No obvious tumor was seen in
the chest computerized tomography scan.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications as an outpatient, none.
Medications on transfer were Heparin subcutaneously, Morphine
and Ativan prn.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with one son and her
grandson.  She quit tobacco 30 years ago and smoked less than
half a pack per day for a few years.  She denies alcohol use.
She works at [**Company **] and was working prior to her
Otorhinolaryngology visit.  Before that she worked for 14
years at a Stride-Rite Factory gluing soles to bottom of
shoes.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies at an outside hospital
revealed sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate
31, BUN 7, creatinine .8, glucose 128, white blood cell count
8.2, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 300, LDH 228.  Arterial blood
gases, pressor support ventilation of 10 and 5 is 7.54, 27,
and greater than 250.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination vital signs
were 100.2, heartrate 98, blood pressure 141/93, respiratory
rate 14 and oxygen saturations 100%.  In general the patient
is an elderly female in no apparent distress, awake, and
answering questions.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat,
extraocular muscles intact.  Pupils, equal and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Large left-sided neck mass,
nontender, approximately 8 by 8 cm.  Small 1 cm area of
ecchymosis around the biopsy site.  Heart, normal S1 and S2,
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen obese, soft, nontender, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

RADIOGRAPHS:  Chest x-ray from outside hospital, large left
neck mass with questionable mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
endotracheal tube at carina.  Chest computerized tomography
scan without contrast, large neck mass, 7 by 7 in diameter,
left trachea shifted to right, trachea compressed around
endotracheal tube.  Computerized tomography scan of chest
revealed multiple anterior mediastinal lymph nodes and
para-aortic tracheal compression with deviation to the right,
no parenchymal lung lesions are seen, small left pleural
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old female with
left-sided neck mass consistent with squamous cell carcinoma,
most likely of esophageal origin, causing airway compromise,
intubated for airway protection.

1.  Left-sided neck mass - On arrival to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was evaluated by
Radiation [**Hospital 44889**] Medical Oncology and Otorhinolaryngology.
It was felt given the size of the mass that extubation could
not be done safely without further securing the airway.  The
patient had a computerized tomography scan of the neck and
chest with contrast and an magnetic resonance imaging scan of
the chest which revealed the following.  Computerized
tomography scan of the head revealed no evidence of
intracranial metastatic disease.  Computerized tomography
scan of the chest showed a large neck mass which tracks along
the posterior wall of the trachea into the thoracic inlet,
measuring 7 by 11 cm, multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph
nodes and a small lower thoracic vertebral body hemangioma.
The magnetic resonance imaging scan of the neck with
gadolinium showed redemonstration of an enormous neck mass
with probable infiltration in the region of the left carotid
sheath and other signs of spread.

In light of these findings, the patient was scheduled for
Operating Room placement of a tracheostomy.  The patient was
sent to the Operating Room on [**2119-10-26**], hospital day
#9.  In the Operating Room the procedure was noted to be very
difficult and a tracheoesophageal fistula was found.  The
patient's trachea was dissected to the fifth tracheal ring
and an endotracheal tube was placed instead of a stable
tracheostomy tube, given the difficulty of the procedure.  On
hospital day #10, the patient had an open gastrostomy tube
placed and a Port-A-Cath placed by General Surgery.  A
panendoscopy was done at the time of her tracheostomy
placement on hospital day #10 which showed diffuse tumor in
both the trachea and the esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were
done of the esophagus and it was felt at this time that the
tumor was originating from the cervical esophagus, although
this could not be definitely confirmed.

On the day after gastrostomy tube and Port-A-Cath placement,
extensive discussions were taken with the family.
Interventional Pulmonology was consulted for possible
stenting of the esophageal tracheal fistula, however, given
the location it was felt that no stent could be placed in
either the esophagus or the trachea at this time.  Given the
poor prognosis with the extent of disease, complicated by the
tracheoesophageal fistula, the decision on whether to pursue
radiation and chemotherapy was in question.  The patient met
with both radiation oncology and medical oncology and was
told about the risks and benefits of treatment.  Given the
fistula, it was thought that radiation and chemotherapy,
while possibly able to provide some local control of tumor
extension, would only worsen the fistula and cause
neutropenia increasing infection risk.  The patient decided
that she wanted to not pursue chemotherapy and radiation
therapy and would want to go home with home hospice care.
The patient was also made Do-Not-Resuscitate at this time.

Given the unusual nature of the patient's tracheostomy tube,
a customized tracheostomy was ordered and is currently
enroute to the hospital.  The patient is to have a more
permanent airway placed on Wednesday, [**11-8**].  If the
patient is able to tolerate the patient and her airway
remains stable, she should be able to be discharged home with
maximal home services.

During this hospitalization palliative care was consulted to
aid in placement and home services.  They are currently
following the patient and have already provided some possible
resources for the patient.

2.  Tracheobronchitis -  On hospital day #2 the patient had a
bronchoscopy to evaluate for any intrinsic compression of
airways by the neck mass.  Airways appeared patent below the
endotracheal tube, however, numerous secretions were seen.
BAL later grew out Staphylococcus aureus which was
pansensitive.  The patient completed a ten-day course of
Levaquin and Clindamycin which was later added after the
tracheal esophageal fistula was found.  Currently, the
patient has occasional secretions and lowgrade temperatures,
however, secretions overall have decreased this admission and
the patient's cough has not increased.  We will try to
observe the patient off of antibiotics but anticipate that
she may continue to have lowgrade fevers due to her
tracheoesophageal fistula and extent of tumor burden.

3.  Urinary tract infection - The patient had an urinary
tract infection during this admission which was Escherichia
coli pansensitive.  The patient was treated with Levaquin,
and subsequent cultures have remained negative.  The Foley
catheter was discontinued on hospital day #19.

4.  Thrush - It was noted that the patient has several
plaques on her tongue and was started on Nystatin Swish and
Swallow which will have to continue while at home.

5.  Constipation - It was noted that the patient had multiple
episodes of constipation in the setting of Roxicet narcotic
use for incisional pain.  This has resolved with an adequate
bowel regimen.

6.  Physical therapy - The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy who felt that the patient may be able to be
discharged home with maximal services.  The patient has been
ambulating without complications.

7.  Respiratory status - The patient was initially on vent
support, however, this was slowly weaned during her hospital
course and she is currently on a T-piece 24 hours a day
without any necessary vent support.  She should be able to go
home with a similar apparatus.  She no longer needs any vent
support.

8.  Tubes, lines and drains - The patient has had her Foley
catheter discontinued.  She has a Port-A-Cath which has been
deaccessed and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube.  She is currently receiving tube feeds 24 hours a day
at 60 cc/hr.

9.  Code status - The patient is currently
Do-Not-Resuscitate.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Stage 4 cervical esophageal cancer
2.  Airway compromise, status post tracheostomy
3.  Tracheobronchitis
4.  Urinary tract infection
5.  Thrush
6.  Constipation
