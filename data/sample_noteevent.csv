Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo f w/ h/o CRI, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea,
c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc,
and negative ct. A brief-problem based hospital course is
outlined below.

1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin
and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad
spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was
initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and
trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so
diagnosis remains presumptive.  C. diff B toxin was sent and was
negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and
IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She
subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was
able to tolerate PO's.

2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with
resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had
no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we
were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel
or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of
tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic
phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal
pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing
severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not
surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage
was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results
showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po
vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is
quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were
the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and
resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there
may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was
performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis,
following completion of cdiff treatment.

2) acute renal failure w/ CRI-  Renal team was consulted on
admisison.  Baseline cr is approx 2.0.  On admission this was
significantly elevated to 4.1.  FENA was c/w prerenal etiology
and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume
resusciation.  This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an
albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT.  Fluids
were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day
and the patient has maintained oxygenation.   Alb/cr ratio not
c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low
alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of
500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and
improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and
returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that
her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to
ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive
overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis
given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips.
However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with
diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which
was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her
lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down
to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of
discharge.

3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic
on admisison.   Unclear why it was low when patient presented.
Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev
lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC
workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose
as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range
for the duration of her hosital course.

4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On
admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP
responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive.
She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and
isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.

5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be
40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event
precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to
have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal
hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to
her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed
medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for
management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV
lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU
briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her
CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative
approximately 500 cc overnight). She was transferred back to the
floor on lasix boluses.

Due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg
IV [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. Then started
nesiritide [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min.
Diuresed well to this and maintained BP well, however after
increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. Stopped
natrecor on [**5-17**]. Stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent
good diuresis. Now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day +
afterload reduction w/ Isordil/Hydral on [**5-22**]. At the time of
discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching
ins and outs daily. We will continue her on this regimen upon
discharge.

7.  Atrial fibrillation: Initially converted from RAF by medical
cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the CCU at
13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. Became
hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. Then
again went into RAF on [**5-17**] early am. Initially HR controlled w/
IV lopressor/IV dilt. Then [**Hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/
procainamide. Became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10
minutes on procainamide [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and her blood
pressures normalized. She then converted 10 min later to NSR.
She has been in NSR the remainder of her hospital course. She is
not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. In addition, amiodorone
was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control.
However, given the side effect profile, the family and patient
were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at
this time. They understand that there is a higher risk of
conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for
stroke without amiodorone.  We will continue rate control with
metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg TID, and may titrate up as
needed to maintain HR <80.

8. CAD- wall motion abnormalities on ECHO w/ inferoseptal/basal
HK. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical
management. On statin/b-blocker. No plan for cath at this time
given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. Also holding off on
aspirin currently given her bleed risk. This will be
re-addressed as an outpatient through her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

9. Anemia- Initially had episode of GI bleed with blood loss
anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit
subsequently normalized. However, she subsequently was noted to
have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. Repeat stool
guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of
bleed or hemolysis. Iron stores were also found to be within
normal limits, with low TIBC and high ferritin suggesting anemia
of chronic disease. This was felt likely secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency. She was started on EPO 2,000 Units q m,w,fr
on [**5-22**]. The goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her
history of CAD, however, we have held off on further transfusion
at this time given her known CHF with recent severe volume
overload. We have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused
with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg IV lasix for hct
<28.

10. tachypnea- Resolved. Her transient tachypnea was felt likely
secondary to volume overload. There was no evidence of
infiltrate by CXR. Her ABG at the time on [**5-15**] showed
7.29/43/99. Her respiratory status subsequently improved that
same day on [**5-15**] following IV lasix and atrovent nebulizers.
Avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.

11. F/E/N- Started on TPN for nutritional supplementation. She
also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated
regular solids and thin liquids. She has been taking in PO's as
tolerated, but has continued to require TPN to reach nutritional
goals. This will be continued upon discharge at rehab.

History of Present Illness:
* interview conducted with the aid of Ms. [**Known lastname 1862**] daughter
.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o F with
history of nephrotic CRI, renal artery stenosis, and CHF, who
presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. The
patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until
3 days prior to admission. At that time, her BP was 220 systolic
@ home and she noticed mild SOB. On the night prior to
admission, she developed increasing SOB. Per the patient's
daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. She
denies chest pain throughout this time. She was brought in by
daughter to [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and was found to have BP 202/40
with a K of 5.9. She was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40
IV, clonidine 0.3 mg PO X 1, and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1.
.
The patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was
found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5LNC (mid
80s on 2LNC), 96% on face tent, RR > 40. As she was acutely
dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg IV lasix and
Diuril (on the advice of Renal consultants), w/ good effect->
UOP 350cc in ~1hour. She did not receive any nitrates or
morphine at the time. On MICU evaluation was 99% on shovel mask,
but still RR>40. Appeared comfortable, JVP ~9 cm. At that time,
she denied HA, visual changes, CP, urinary changes, no abd pain,
N/V/D. In the MICU, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on
her usual blood pressure regimen. Overnight [**Date range (1) 1873**], she did
not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her BPs were in
the 110s/120s overnight. She did receive all doses of clonidine
and hydralazine on [**5-9**].
.
Her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but
that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. She has
been using several pillows to sleep at home. She denies PND. She
is not on supplemental O2 at home. Generally BP at home is 170s
(per PCP 160s in office at baseline).
.
Pt was diagnosed with w/ RLL PNA by her PCP and tx [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/
levofloxacin X 10 days about 4 weeks ago. Since that time, the
daughter has been living with the pt X 3 weeks. Her cough has
persisted per the daughter, but the patient did improve greatly
following antibiotics.
.
At the present time, the patient says she is comfortable. She
denies chest pain. She continues to make adequate urine.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2194-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure,
worse since the exam of one month ago.
.
[**2194-5-8**] ECHO: TTE Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%).
.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic.
.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-9-19**], borderline mitral stenosis is now evident.
The mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly
underestimated on this study, is probably increased.
.
[**2194-5-11**] CXR TWO VIEWS: Comparison with the previous study done
[**2194-5-9**]. There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary
edema. The mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Streaky
density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and
small left pleural effusion. An underlying right basilar
consolidation cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old female with probable endstage
renal failure not on HD, who presented with hypertensive
emergency and congestive heart failure.  She was admitted to the
medical floor but immediately was sent to the MICU for
respiratory distress. There she was agressively diuresed and
then returned to the medical floor.
.
* Hypertensive Emergency: Her HTN is likely secondary to her
ESRD.  The elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure.  She was given blood pressure
medications to help control her BP within the range of 130-160
as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion.
 Her baseline BP is reportedly 160 at home.  Ultimately she was
placed on clonidine 0.2 mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, norvasc
10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg TID, lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
* ? SVT: During her initally presentation, she did have some
runs of SVT noted on telemetry.  Once she was diuresed no
further episodes were noted.  She was continued on metoprolol
12.5 mg TID for given episodes of ? SVT.
.
* Congestive Heart Failure: Likely from worsening renal failure
and hypertensive urgency. She was agressively diuresed in the
MICU with IV furosemide overnight and then with PO furosemide on
the medical floor. She was also continued on hydralazine for
afterload reduction.
.
* Renal Failure: A renal consult was obtained.  They felt that
there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they
have been discussing starting HD with the patient and her family
for a while now.  This discussion was continued throughout the
admission and the patient and her family were resistent to
starting.  They agreed to meet with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in the next two
weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting HD.
Throughout admission, her electrolytes were monitored closely as
she had boughts of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.
 These were controlled with standard measures.
.
* Hyperkalemia: Received Kayexalate in ED. Usually takes
kayexalate twice a week as outpatient, so this was restarted as
an inpatient.
.
* Anemia: Baseline Hct appears to be 29-33 and now 25. Iron 45,
ferritin 149, TIBC 269 in [**3-5**]. Per renal recommendation, she
was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**2194-5-12**] without complications.
.
* Bacteremia: WBC count 10 on admission and down to 6.4 today.
Has been afebrile but blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles with
staph coag negative- likely contaminant. Before speciation
returned, she was treated with vancomycin dosed by level. Once
it was found to be coag negative staph, the vancomycin was
discontinued. All subsequent surveillence cultures were
negative.
.
* Code status: Full - discussed w/ patient's daughter.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 86F with h/o colon cancer, ESRD on
hemodialysis, diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and prior
cephalic vein thrombosis who presented to the ED on [**8-15**] with
dyspnea.

The patient's dialysis catheter became dislodged [**8-12**].
Consequently she missed her normal dialysis session [**8-13**]. On
[**8-14**] she had a new tunneled catheter placed, but was not
dialyzed. The afternoon of [**8-14**] her daughter noticed that the
patient seemed increasingly dyspneic and was hypertensive to
200's. She was given hydralazine and clonidine and the BP
improved to 160's. She called her daughter ~3am on [**8-15**] due to
worsening dyspnea. The patient denies any accompanying headache,
vision changes, chest discomfort, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, cough, weakness or loss of sensation. EMS was called,
and she was given CPAP with some relief of her dyspnea. Per her
daughter, similar symptoms have occurred 3 times in the past.

In the ED her vitals were BP 258/61 RR 28 O2 100% on CPAP, 89%
on room air (temperature was not recorded). She was started on a
nitroglycerin drip, and given calcium and bicarbonate for a
potassium of 7.1. She was weaned off NIPPV, with O2 saturation
of 97% on 3L NC. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU for
further monitoring and dialysis.

Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Stage V chronic kidney disease, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].
3) Diastolic CHF (EF 60% on TTE in [**5-3**]), likely volume related
in the setting of her renal disease.
4) Rheumatic fever, with the following valvular abnormalities:
Mild aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
stenosis, mild to moderate MR, mild TR.
5) Severe PA systolic hypertension
6) Renal artery stenosis:  MRI [**2185**] atrophic R kidney, moderate
stenosis of R renal artery, L renal artery normal.
7) Peripheral vascular disease:  Has claudication.
8) Right cephalic vein DVT in [**6-/2193**]
9) Colon cancer in [**2-/2192**], status post resection.
10) Hyperlipidemia
11) Right bundle branch block
12) Anemia of renal failure
13) Osteoarthritis
14) Osteopenia
15) Glaucoma


Social History:
Lives at home, usually alone, but recently the daughter has
moved in with her.  She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use IV
drugs.

[**8-15**] CXR
FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest on upright position.  The
cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated on this AP view.  The
right-sided central venous catheter is unchanged.  The left
costophrenic angle is blunted consistent with pleural effusions.
 Left lung base atelectasis are noted.  There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There is a right lung base opacity obscuring the
right-side cardiac border which may represent right middle lobe
atelectasis vs. pneumonia. Pprominence of the pulmonary
vasculature is noted, consistent with mild CHF. The osseous
structures are unchanged.
  IMPRESSION:
1.  Right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
2.  Mild CHF with small left- sided pleural effusion.

[**8-15**] EKG
Sinus bradycardia at 56bpm, left axis, old RBBB, peaked T's that
are new compared to [**2194-6-24**] EKG. Inverted T in V3 on [**6-2**] EKG
has flipped to positive. No signs of acute ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary
from volume overload, occuring in the context of ESRD and a
missed hemodialysis session, as well as hypertension leading to
flash pulmonary edema. Her dyspnea following hemodialysis.

2. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension is also likely
related to volume overload. Her blood pressures improved
following dialysis and resumption of her home course of toprol,
clonidine, amlodipine, and hydralazine.

3. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium normalized following
dialysis.

4. ESRD - Renal following, on dialysis MWF.

5. FEN - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps.

[**6-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-14**] and 22:
Intraaortic balloon pump has been removed. Lung volumes remain
low with persistent atelectasis at the right base, but
insufficient abnormality in the lungs to explain respiratory
failure. Moderate cardiomegaly and a generally large and
tortuous thoracic aorta are unchanged in appearance. There is no
pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion. Tip of
endotracheal tube is in standard placement at the thoracic
inlet. No pneumothorax.
.
[**6-19**] CT head IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage
.
[**6-22**] Ct Abd Pelvis IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal collection or large hematoma.
2. Small amount of fluid and air and moderate amount of air in
the abdomen likely related to the peritoneal dialysis.
3. Multicystic kidneys. Some of the cysts are complex and not
well evaluated in this non-contrast study. Some of the cysts are
increased when compared to prior study. There is a new area of
calcification in the left kidney. If indicated this cysts could
be further evaluated with ultrasound or MRI.
4. Gallstones.
5. Severe coronary artery calcifications.
.
Cath report:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a left dominant system.
LMCA
had a 20% origin stenosis. The LAD had a 90% origin stenosis
involving
also a D1 (90%). Rest of the LAD was diffusely diseased with
60-70%
sequential lesions. LCX had mild itraluminal irregularities with
50% OM
and 60% distal LCX disease. RCA was chronically occluded
distally with
R->L and R->R collaterals.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Aortic root aortography showed markedly dilated aortic root.
4. Hemodynamic assessment reaveled a depressed Cardiac Index
1.7-1.9
and PCWP of 35 (with large V-waves).
5. The lesion in the proximal LAD was predilated with a 2.0 X
09mm
Maverick balloon and stented with a 2.5 X 12mm Minivision stent.
The
final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis,
6. Under fluoroscopic guidance, we then placed a 40cc intra
aortic
balloon pump just beyond the left subclavian origin. Successful
diastolic augmentation of blood pressure was achieved.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca
and IABP.
 PTCA of  vessel.
4. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD lesion with a bare
metal
stent.
5. Successful placement of a 40cc intra aortic balloon pump.
.
[**6-15**] TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with moderate cavity dilation and severe
global hypokinesis. The basal inferior and inferolateral walls
contract best with the more distal left ventricular segments
near akinetic. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. No
intraventricular thrombus is identified. Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images reviewed)
of [**2130-10-4**], the left ventricular findings are new and c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation and
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now present.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)
.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2133-6-22**] and portable
abdomen [**2133-6-22**].
.
ABDOMEN, UPRIGHT AND SUPINE: Only one of these radiographs
includes the right hemidiaphragm. There are small ovoid-shaped
collections of free intra- abdominal air layering above the
liver and stomach. Large and small bowel are of normal caliber.
There is no evidence of obstruction. Extensive stool is noted
within the right colon. A peritoneal dialysis catheter coils
over the left abdomen into the pelvis. Surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are unchanged.
.
IMPRESSION: Small collections of free intra-abdominal air above
the liver and stomach which is expected given presence of
peritoneal dialysis catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 68yo M with ESRD on PD, prostate Ca p/w ACS and
severe 2VD presented with CP and taken to cath lab and found to
have 2VD with stent to LAD and subsequent mental status changes
that have steadily improved.
.
#. CV:
a. [**Name (NI) 2694**] Pt went directly to the cath lab on admission where
he was found to have significant 2VD, s/p bare metal stent to
proximal LAD.  Patient was s/p ACS with unclear culprit lesion,
developed cardiogenic shock and was intubated in CCU for several
days.  Per CT [**Doctor First Name **], was determined not to be a CABG candidate
due to poor touchdowns and severe R sided lesions.  His course
was complicated by a groin bleed (see below).  Continued ASA,
Plavix and high dose statin, and titrated BB to Metoprolol XL
200 mg PO DAILY. Due to known residual coronary lesions, Isordil
10mg TID was initially added for better CP control, but was
ultimately d/c'ed due to low BPs, with the addition of SL NTG
prn for chest pain.  Was initially on Lisinopril 30 mg PO DAILY,
which was also ultimately decreased to 10mg PO QD due to low BP.
Beta blockade will be the most important factor in the medical
management of his CAD, and should not be decreased if at all
possible. He was discharged on Toprol XL 150 mg QD. He should
have f/u with cardiology within the next 6-8 weeks, and see his
PCP soon after discharge from rehabilitation facility.
.
b. Pump - cardiogenic shock, newly depressed EF.  He had
significant volume o/l and LV dysfunction. An IABP was in place
(1:1) with hep gtt after cath.  The balloon was subsequently
removed and we titrated up inotropes/pressors to MAP > 60, CI >
2
A PCWP > 40 determined that he needed aggressive diuresis which
he underwent via PD with renal service following.  Several
liters of fluid were removed by PD and was maintained at
relatively even volume exchanges for several days prior to
discharge.
.
c. Rhythm- AIVR in ED, NSR since. QTc was monitored in setting
of Haldol administration, and was consistently in normal range.
.
#. ESRD on PD x several years -- volume o/l by elev PCWP on
admission, s/p fluid removal by PD for several days, now
euvolemic on exam with even volume exchanges.  Renal following
and maintaining even Is/Os.  He should continue with daily
peritoneal dialysis. He should follow-up with his nephrologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] on discharge from rehab facility.
.
#. Groin hematoma- Pt had rapidly expanding groin hematoma of
his right groin in setting of heparin s/p cath.  He was
reintubated in setting of pain when he was uncontrollable and
thrashing in bed.  Hematoma was tamponaded with a pressure
dressing and external fixture and was controlled by the
following day. He had a HCT drop in setting of bleed.
Peripheral pulses were still dopplerable (baseline) throughout.
This has now resolved, with persistent ecchymosis, but stable
HCT x 5 days.
.
#. S/p intubation- done for agitation purposes at first in the
cath lab.  He was successfully weaned by HD #3 but reintubated
the next day s/p groin bleed and uncontrolled behavior,
including trying to get out of bed and resisting pressure on his
bleeding groin.  He was successfully weaned a second time and as
his MS has improved, he has not required further intubation.
.
#. Acute MS changes: Pt has been agitated at times, generally in
the setting of pain, and seemed to have no clear understanding
of what was going on.  He has been on several sedatives and
could have been experiencing medication effects s/p extubation.
His mental status started to clear. He passed speech and
swallow, now on regular renal/cardiac diet.  CT head [**6-19**] ruled
out bleed/new process but did show old lacunar infarct.
Continued Haldol HS and PRN Haldol as needed, with input from
psychiatry service.  His MS improved daily and was near baseline
at time of discharge, with minimal need for Haldol. His Haldol
was discontinued several days before discharge.  His mental
status is approaching baseline, however, he still has some
difficulty performing his own peritoneal dialysis.  He will need
ongoing education in this process while at rehab.
.
#. Abdominal discomfort:  Developed on [**6-22**].  There were initial
concerns for peritoneal fluid infection in setting of ongoing
PD, and dialysate was pink-tinged. Pain may have been due to
hematoma from subcutaneous heparin, which was d/c'ed prior to
d/c, as patient was ambulating well CT Abdomen ruled out bleed,
or other pathology that could explain his symptoms.  Peritoneal
fluid analysis from [**6-22**] showed gram positive cocci in pairs,
not yet speciated. His cell count from his peritoneal fluid was
low, with a very low number of PMNS. He received vancomycin 2 gm
IP x 1; he should have a second dose on [**2133-6-28**].  He had guaiac
negative stool on day of discomfort. LFTs were normal, as were
amylase and lipase. A plain film of the abdomen on [**6-24**]
demonstrates a small amount of intra-abdominal free air, which
is likely secondary to a PD cath that was uncapped for too long.
Repeat analysis of peritoneal fluid showed on 33 WBC, 14% PMNs.
Abdominal pain had significantly improved on day of discharge.
.
#. Guaiac + stools: Pt has documented history of this before and
during this admission, but not for last several days.
Outpatient colonoscopy should be arranged.  HCT remained stable.
.
#. Prostate Ca- Not acute issue while in-house. PSA 0.4. Has f/u
appt with oncology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Death Summary (please see hospital chart for further details):

The pt was admitted w/ CP and SOB as above.  His admission ECG
was unchanged from prior. Cardiac enzymes were elevated, though
trending down.  The morning following admission the pt felt
severe chest pain.  Shortly thereafter he was found to be
bradycardic --> PEA cardiac arrest in the setting of
hyperkalemia.  He received ACLS treatment, including sodium
bicarbonate, and regained normal rhythm and a blood pressure
(estimated resuscitation time <5minutes, pulseless time <20
seconds).  He was taken to the cardiac cath lab, where both the
LAD and LCx stents were widely patent.  He was treated for
hyperkalemia, and a balloon pump was inserted for cardiogenic
shock.
Though the pt was weaned off the IABP, his subsequent hospital
course was complicated.  He was unable to be weaned off
mechanical ventilation (pt developed VAP) and had numerous other
complicating issues.  Because of his very poor prognosis, the
pt's family decided to make him care and comfort measures only
on [**2133-8-9**].  The pt died with his family by his side on [**2133-8-10**]
at 2100.

Date of Birth:   [**2080-11-2**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CA/TH [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 -year-old male
patient who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] through the Emergency Department on [**2149-11-15**],
with increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had a
previous hospitalization from [**11-2**] through [**11-6**]
for which he was scheduled for an attempted apical
canalization.  However, he was found to have significant
aortic insufficiency and the procedure was aborted.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was discharged home on [**2149-11-6**], without
diuretic and he was scheduled to undergo aortic valve
replacement on [**11-17**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  On
admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have a
chest x-ray which was significant for a right pleural
effusion as well as congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft times five in [**2140**].
2.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2129**].
3.  Aortic stenosis with aortic insufficiency with a
calculated aortic valve area of 0.8-0.9.
4.  Asthma.
5.  ETOH abuse.  The patient states that last drink was on
[**2149-11-15**].  The patient admits to smoking one pack a
day; however, has significantly higher smoking history in the
past, up to three to four packs a day per patient's family.
6.  The patient also has a history of multiple falls with
rib, ankle, and forearm fractures in the past, question if
this is related to his alcohol intake.
7.  He is status post radical prostatectomy in [**2145**].
8.  He is status post rectal polypectomy.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg po q day, Zoloft 50 mg
po q day, carvedilol 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **], Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states that an intolerance to
sedation as this causes increased confusion and agitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission, the patient
was afebrile, his pulse was 56 in normal sinus rhythm, his
blood pressure was 107/50, respiratory rate 17, and on room
air oxygen saturation was 88%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat unremarkable.  Neck without jugular venous distention.
Chest with crackles one third of the way up on the right.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is obese,
positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities
are without edema and he had 2+ palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Extremities were warm.  Neurologically the patient's
cranial nerves II through XII were intact and he was alert
and oriented at the time of admission.  Strength was [**4-5**].

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Revealed a white blood cell count
of 7,700, hematocrit 34.6, platelet count 195,000.  Sodium
138, BUN of 26, creatinine of 1.0, and blood glucose of 85.
His electrocardiogram on admission to the hospital was normal
sinus rhythm with a left anterior fascicular block and a
right bundle branch block as well as left ventricular
hypertrophy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**11-16**], the patient received a
dental consult and he was cleared by the Dental Service to
undergo an aortic valve replacement.  On [**11-17**], the
patient went to the Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**], where he underwent an aortic endarterectomy as well as
an aortic valve replacement with a #20 3.0 mm [**Location (un) **] valve.

Postoperatively the patient was transported from the
Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on IV
milrinone.  His postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 35-40% which was an
improvement from preoperative ventricular function.  The
patient was on propofol; however, had increasing agitation,
was placed on dexmedetomidine for sedation at that time.  He
was weaned from the mechanical ventilator and extubated in
the evening on postoperative day one.

The patient had a cardiac index of greater than 3.0 on
Levophed and milrinone drip.  The milrinone was discontinued
on the evening of postoperative day one.  The patient
initially on extubation, was quite confused; however, no
agitated at that time.  The patient was started on
nitroprusside due to hypertension and oral Captopril was
added.  The patient continued to have a fair amount of chest
tube drainage from his pleural tube, of serosanguinous fluid
so that was left in for another couple of days.

The patient, on postoperative day two, required Haldol and
Ativan due to increasing confusion and agitation.  He
required soft restraints for patient safety.  The patient
wound up being oversedated due to his severe agitation,
requiring re-intubation because of respiratory compromise.
This occurred on [**11-22**], which was postoperative day
five.  A Neurology Medicine consult was obtained at that time
and their conclusion was that this may be related to alcohol
withdrawal.  The patient had a CT scan of his head which was
negative.  Their thought is the alcohol withdrawal could be
contributing.  He could also have decreased clearance of all
the sedating medicines which he received for previous
agitation due to renal and hepatic dysfunction.

On [**11-21**], the patient experienced rapid atrial
fibrillation which was treated with Lopressor.  The patient
was not given amiodarone at that time because he has a
history of slow heart rate as well as questionable liver
function due to his alcohol history.  The patient was
converted to normal sinus rhythm; however, had intermittent
pauses without appropriate capture of the pacemaker via his
epicardial wires.

The patient was started on postoperative day five on tube
feedings, the day he was re-intubated.  He continued to have
copious endotracheal tube secretions with his re-intubation.
His sputum was sent for culture which was found to have
Enterobacter and he was started on levofloxacin at that time.
The patient extubated himself later that evening and
remained confused and extremely agitated.  He was restarted
on Haldol and Ativan.

The patient require aggressive pulmonary toilet, continued to
have respiratory acidosis; however, was unable to stay
extubated.  On [**11-24**], the patient was reintubated due
to significant hypercarbia and respiratory distress,
respiratory acidosis.  He had required a fair amount of
sedation a couple of days leading up to that due to his
profound agitation, questionably related to alcohol
withdrawal.  At the time of the reintubation, he was found to
have thick tan secretions, although his repeat cultures were
negative.  Pulmonary toilet was continued, aggressive
diuresis was continued, and tube feeds were resumed.

The patient was extubated again on [**11-27**].  At that time
his mental status had improved, felt to be questionable
resolving encephalopathy.  He had some intermittent
confusion, but much less agitation.  He was receiving some
Haldol.  The patient was continued on tube feeds via
nasogastric tube.  On [**11-28**], the patient underwent a
swallowing evaluation by the Speech Therapy Department.
Since he did not pass his bedside evaluation, it was
recommended that he go for a video swallow which showed that
he was at risk for aspiration.  Tube feeds were continued at
that time.

The patient progressed throughout the day with increasing
agitation, attempting to discontinue IV lines, arterial
catheter, as well as his nasogastric tube, and a one-to-one
sitter was obtained at that time.  Due to the patient's
tenuous respiratory status, he was kept in the Intensive Care
Unit where aggressive pulmonary toilet was continued.

On [**11-30**], the patient's mental status had significantly
improved.  On [**12-1**], the patient was transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor.  He was noted
to have questionable arrhythmia of either non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia, versus wide complex supraventricular
tachycardia; however, he continued to have multiple episodes
of this.  The patient's epicardial pacing wires were
discontinued on [**2149-12-3**].

The patient's primary cardiology group was consulted about
the arrhythmia issues.  He was seen here by the
Electrophysiology service and it was decided upon that the
patient would be transferred to [**Hospital6 3872**]
under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], who would
plan to take him for electrophysiology study at [**Hospital6 3873**] and questionable automatic implantable
cardioverter - defibrillator placement as indicated.

On [**12-4**], the patient was reassessed by the speech
therapist and it was their recommendation at that time that
he was stable, that his swallowing had improved
significantly, that he could continue with supervised
feedings only and it was their recommendation to continue
tube feeds until he was able to take an adequate oral intake.

The patient's most recent laboratory values are from [**2149-12-2**], which revealed a white blood cell count of 10,900,
hematocrit of 31.7, and a platelet count of 391,000.  Sodium
146, potassium 4.8, (the repeat of his potassium the
following day was 4.7) chloride 106, CO2 34, BUN 31,
creatinine 0.7, blood glucose 109.  PT 12.3, PTT 31.2.

Condition today, [**2149-12-5**], the day of discharge is as
follows: the patient is without complaints.  The patient's
tube feeds have been on hold; however, he does continue with
the nasogastric tube in place.  Temperature is 97.9 F, pulse
58 and normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 106/96, oxygen
saturation is 98% on four liters nasal cannula.  His 24 hours
intakes and outputs were 860 in, 670 out as of midnight last
night.  The coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm.
His sternum is stable without drainage.  His lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally.

Date of Birth:   [**2080-11-2**]       Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 year old male
patient who was admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] through the Emergency Department on [**2149-11-15**],
with increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had a
previous hospitalization from [**11-2**] through [**11-6**], for which he was scheduled for an attempted apical
conization, however, he was found to have significant aortic
insufficiency and the procedure was aborted.  The patient was
discharged home on [**2149-11-6**], without diuretic and he
was scheduled to undergo aortic valve replacement on [**11-17**], with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 3876**].

On admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have a
chest x-ray which was significant for a right pleural
effusion as well as congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
    bypass graft times five in [**2140**].
2.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2129**].
3.  Aortic stenosis with aortic insufficiency with a
    calculated aortic valve area of 0.8 to 0.9.
4.  Asthma.
5.  ETOH abuse; the patient states his last drink was on
    [**2149-11-15**].
6.  The patient admits to smoking one pack per day, however,
    has a significantly higher smoking history in the past up
    to three to four pack per day per patient's family.
7.  The patient has also had a history of multiple falls with
    rib, ankle, and forearm fractures in the past; question
    if this is related to his alcohol intake.
8.  He is status post radical prostatectomy in [**2145**].
9.  He is status post rectal polypectomy.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zoloft 50 mg q. day.
3.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg twice a day.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states an intolerance to sedation as
this causes increased confusion and agitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  The patient
was afebrile.  His pulse was 56 in normal sinus rhythm.  His
blood pressure was 107/50; respiratory rate 17 and room air
oxygen saturation was 88%.  On physical examination, HEENT
unremarkable.  Neck without jugular venous distention.  Chest
with crackles one-third of the way up on the right.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is obese,
positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.  His
extremities were without edema and he had two plus palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses and his extremities were warm.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII are intact and
he is alert and oriented at the time of admission.  Strength
was [**4-5**].

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  Revealed a
white blood cell count of 7,700, hematocrit 34.6, platelet
count 195,000, sodium 138, BUN of 26, creatinine of 1.6 and
blood glucose of 85.

His EKG on admission to the hospital was normal sinus rhythm
with a left anterior fascicular block and a right bundle
branch block as well as left ventricular hypertrophy.

On the [**11-16**], the patient received a dental
consult and he was cleared by the dental service to undergo
an aortic valve replacement.  On [**11-17**], the patient
went to the Operating Room where he underwent an aortic
endarterectomy as well as an aortic valve replacement with a
#23 mm [**Location (un) **] valve.

Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on
intravenous Milrinone.  His postoperative transesophageal
echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%
which was an improvement in his preoperative ventricular
function.  The patient was on Profadol, however, had
increasing agitation and was placed on Dexmedetomidine for
sedation at that time.  He was weaned from the mechanical
ventilator and extubated in the evening on postoperative day
one.  The patient had a cardiac index of greater than 3 on
Levophed and Milrinone drip.  The Milrinone was discontinued
on the evening of postoperative day one.  The patient,
initially, on extubation was quite confused, however, not
agitated at that time.  The patient was started on
nitroprusside due to hypotension and oral Captopril was
added.  The patient continued to have a fair amount of chest
tube drainage from his pleural tube of serosanguinous fluid
so that was left in for another couple of days.

The patient, on postoperative day two, required Haldol and
Ativan due to increase in confusion and agitation.  He
required soft restraints for patient's safety.  The patient
wound up being over sedated due to his severe agitation,
requiring re-intubation because of respiratory compromised
that had occurred on [**11-22**] which was postoperative day
five.

A [**Hospital 878**] medical consultation was obtained at that time
and their conclusion was that this may be related to alcohol
withdrawal.  The patient had a CT scan of his head which was
negative.  Their thought was that the alcohol withdrawal
could be contributing.  Also, he could also have decreased
clearance of all the sedating medicines which he received for
previous agitation due to renal and hepatic dysfunction.  On
the [**11-21**], the patient experienced rapid atrial
fibrillation which was treated with Lopressor.  The patient
was not given Amiodarone at that time because there is a
history of slow heart rate as well as questionable liver
function due to his alcohol history.  The patient was
converted to normal sinus rhythm however, has had
intermittent pauses without appropriate capture with his
pacemaker via his epicardial wires.

The patient was started on postoperative day five on tube
feedings, the day he was reintubated.  He continued to have
copious endotracheal tube secretions with his reintubation.
His sputum was sent for culture which was found to have
Enterobacter and he was started on Levofloxacin at that time.
The patient extubated himself later that evening, remained
confused and extremely agitated and was restarted on Haldol
and Ativan.  The patient required aggressive pulmonary toilet
and continued to have respiratory acidosis, however, was
unable to stay extubated.  On the [**11-24**], the
patient was reintubated due to significant hypercarbia and
respiratory distress and respiratory acidosis.  He had
required a fair amount of sedation a couple of days leading
up to that due to his profound agitation questionably related
to alcohol withdrawal.  At the time of the reintubation, he
was found to have thick tan secretions, although his repeat
cultures were negative.  Pulmonary toilet was continued and
aggressive diuresis was continued and tube feeds were
resumed.

The patient was extubated again on [**11-27**].  At that
time, his mental status had improved; felt to be questionable
resolving encephalopathy.  He had some intermittent confusion
but much less agitation.  He was receiving some Haldol.  The
patient was continued on tube feeds via nasogastric tube.  On
[**11-28**], the patient underwent a swallowing evaluation
by the Speech Therapy Department as he did not pass his bed
side evaluation.  It was recommended that he go for a video
swallow which showed he was at risk for aspiration.  Tube
feeds were continued at that time.  The patient progressed
throughout the day with increasing agitation, attempting to
discontinue the intravenous line, arterial catheter as well
as the nasogastric tube and a one-to-one sitter was obtained
at that time.

Due to the patient's tenuous respiratory status, he was kept
in the Intensive Care Unit where aggressive pulmonary toilet
was continued.  On the [**11-30**], the patient's mental
status had significantly improved.  On [**12-1**], the
patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the
Telemetry Floor.  He was noted to have questionable
arrhythmia of either non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
versus wide complex supraventricular tachycardia, however, he
continued to have multiple episodes of this.

The patient's epicardial pacing wires were discontinued on
[**2149-12-3**].  The patient's primary Cardiology Group was
consulted about his arrhythmia issues.  He was seen here by
our Electrophysiology Service and it was decided upon that
the patient would be transferred to [**Hospital6 3872**]
under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] who planned
to take him for EP Study at [**Hospital6 3872**] and
questionable AICD placement, if indicated.

On [**12-4**], the patient was reassessed by the Speech
therapist and it was their recommendation at that time that
he was stable.  His swallowing had improved significantly and
that he could continue with supervised feedings only and it
was their recommendation to continue tube feeds until he was
able to take an adequate oral intake.

The patient's most recent laboratory values are from [**2149-12-2**], which revealed a white blood cell count of 10,900,
hematocrit of 31.7 and a platelet count of 391,000.  Sodium
146, potassium 4.8.  The repeat of his potassium the
following day was 4.7.  Chloride 106, CO2 34, BUN 31 and
creatinine 0.7.  Blood glucose of 109.  PT 12.3, PTT 31.2.

His condition today, [**2149-12-5**], the date of discharge
is as follows:  The patient is without complaint.  The
patient's tube feeds have been on hold, however, he does
continue with a nasogastric tube in place.  Temperature is
97.9 F.; pulse 50; normal sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure
106/96.  Oxygen saturation is 98% on four liters of nasal
cannula.  His 24-hour intakes and outputs were 860 and 675
out as of midnight last night.  Coronary examination is
regular rate and rhythm.  The sternum is stable without
drainage.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

The patient's condition is stable.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old gentlemen
who was in previously good health until [**8-15**] when he
felt weak and fell to the ground and also had one episode of
hematemesis.  In retrospect, the patient recalls that one
week prior to admission he had an episode of melena.  Patient
was evaluated at [**Hospital3 3765**] and was found to have a
hematocrit of 25.5.  An nasogastric tube lavage at that time
revealed maroon fluid coffee grounds.  The patient on that
day underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed 2+
varices and erosions in the cardiac antrum.  The patient was
transfused four units of packed red blood cells to stabilize
his hematocrit at 29-30%. The patient underwent a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**8-17**] which again showed
2+ varices and gastritis with no evidence of active bleeding.
 At that point, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] where his hematocrit was
found to be 28.2.  The patient was admitted directly to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient underwent a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**8-18**] which showed Grade
III varices in the lower one third of the esophagus and also
stigmata of recent bleeding.  Four bands were placed around
these varices.  In addition, the esophagogastroduodenoscopy
showed some evidence of gastritis and portal hypertensive
gastropathy with nonbleeding varices in the cardia.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, his creatinine dropped
further to 26 and the patient was given an additional one
unit of packed blood cells to increase his hematocrit to
29.8.  At the time of transfer out of Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient no longer had reported any more episodes of
hematemesis.  He denied any abdominal pain but still noted
tarry stools.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes times 15
years, macular degenerative, chronic urinary tract
infections, no coronary artery disease, left nephrectomy 40
years ago with blood transfusion at that time.

and he is on a macular degeneration study medication.

While in the hospital, the patient was placed on levofloxacin
when there was a question to treat a possible community
acquired pneumonia.  In addition, the patient was placed on
Protonix, propanolol, Lasix and spironolactone.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for any tobacco or alcohol or
injection drug use.  He thinks he may have received
transfusions 40 years ago at the time of his nephrectomy.

with his wife and he denies any common history of liver
disease or liver disease.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure
125/70.  Pulse of 84.  Respirations 24.  02 saturation of 92%
on two liters.  He has [**2-3**] left systolic murmur, heard best
at the left sternal border.  He had no palpable hepatomegaly
and a well-healed nephrectomy scar.  Abdomen was distended
but was not tense.  He had no lymphadenopathy.  He had
palpable distal pulses and trace to 1+ bilateral lower
extremity edema.  He had no asterixes and is alert and
oriented.  He had no spider angiomata, no gynecomastia.  Of
note were occasional scattered cherry angiomata in his trunk.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON TRANSFER OUT OF THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT ARE AS FOLLOWS:  CBC:  White blood cell count 12.3,
hemoglobin and hematocrit of 9.8 and 28.1, platelets of
151,000.  Chemistry panel:  Sodium 142, potassium 3.4,
chloride 115, bicarbonate 20, BUN and creatinine of 19 and
0.8 and glucose of 73.  His calcium was 7.1, his magnesium is
1.6, phosphorus is 2.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was hemodynamically stabilized
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and transferred to the
General Medical Service on the regular floor.  Numerous
hepatology studies were sent off including hepatitis B,
hepatitis C and an autoimmune work-up.  In addition, iron and
ferritin were also sent.  His hepatitis B studies are
currently pending.  His hepatitis C is negative.  His H.
Pylori negative.  His autoimmune antibody studies are all
pending.  His iron is 63 and his ferritin is 41.

An ultrasound on hospital day number three showed the
following results:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope, hematemesis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year-old
male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes
mellitus and esophageal varices who was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] from [**Hospital3 3765**] after
being found down on bathroom floor.  The patient has no
recollection of the event, but states he believes he fell
after getting up to urinate.  The patient's wife found him on
the floor with coffee ground emesis and dark stool.  EMS
arrived and found his blood sugar to be 24. He was given two
ampules of D50 at the scene.  The patient had a further
episode of coffee ground emesis in the ambulance.  At
arrival at [**Hospital3 3765**] the patient's fasting blood
sugars was 59.  His hematocrit was 42.9.  Although the
patient was confused regarding the details of the event, the
patient did note that he felt better after receiving the
glucose.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for a MICU admission.

Upon further questioning the patient states that he has noted
increased abdominal girth over the last one to two days and
ten minutes of sharp right sided chest pain on the day prior
to admission.  The patient states that he felt the pain was
most likely secondary to muscle strain and denies any
association with shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea,
vomiting or diaphoresis.  The patient has been taking his
insulin as per his routine with his last dose being the night
prior to admission.  The patient has not been compliant with
his diuretics over the past few days as he has ran out of his
prescription.  The wife states that she has noted some
yellowing of the patient's eyes as well as decreased po
intake on the day prior to admission.

liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was sitting up
in no acute distress.  His sclera were anicteric.  His chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  There was spider
angiomata and gynecomastia.  Cardiovascular examination was
normal with a regular rate and rhythm.  There was a soft 2
out of 6 systolic ejection murmur in the left upper sternal
border without radiation.  The abdomen was soft, mildly
distended, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  Rectal
examination revealed light brown stool that was hemoccult
negative.  The patient had no costovertebral angle
tenderness.  His extremities had no edema except trace edema
in the left lower extremity to the ankles.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
6.2, hematocrit 35.8 decreased from outside hospital
measurement of 42.9, platelets 109, sodium 140, potassium
3.3, chloride 109, bicarb 25, BUN 7, creatinine 0.7, glucose
137, PT 12.8, PTT 32.8, INR 1.4.  Liver function tests were
within normal limits.  The patient had 6 to 10 white blood
cells on urinalysis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 61 year-old man with known
esophageal varices and liver failure presents with coffee
ground emesis.  The patient was admitted to the medical
Intensive Care Unit for management of presumed upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  His Intensive Care Unit course is as
described below.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  During the course of his
Intensive Care Unit stay the patient exhibited no evidence of
active bleeding.  His hematocrit was 35 on admission and
remained stable with a nadir of 32.2.  The patient had
esophogastroduodenoscopy done, which indicated grade one
(minor) esophageal varices and portal gastropathy.  No
additional banding was indicated.  At the time of transfer to
the floor unit, the patient denied any symptoms of
hematemesis, fatigue or lightheadedness.

2.  Hypoglycemia:  The patient was hypoglycemic at the time
of his episode and when transferred to the [**Hospital3 3765**]
as described above.  Per the patient's wife report the
patient's diet was decreased on the days prior to admission.
The patient took his normal dose of insulin regardless.  The
patient was started on a dextrose drip with blood sugars
ranging less then 150 generally.  He was transitioned to an
insulin sliding scale and blood sugars have remained below
250 generally.  His outpatient insulin regimen was
discontinued until sugars were within normal limits.

3.  Increased abdominal girth:  The patient had been
noncompliant with diuretics for one week prior to admission.
After restarting diuretics abdominal girth decreased.

4.  Chest pain:  The patient described chest pain one day
prior to admission.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were
cycled and found to be negative.

Given the patient's stability in the MICU the patient was
transferred to the floor for continued monitoring.  His
course was as follows.

1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient had no further
episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding.  His hematocrit
remained stable.  He was hemodynamically stable.  He
continued beta blocker therapy for known varices.  He was
discharged to home on his outpatient medications.

2.  Hypoglycemia:  Once the patient was tolerating regular
diet, insulin therapy was reinitiated.  The patient had one
episode of hypoglycemia with a nadir of 47 on [**2196-10-22**].  The
patient has no history of prior hypoglycemic episodes despite
being on his outpatient regimen for over four months.
However, given the initial episode and inpatient episode of
hypoglycemia the patient's outpatient regimen was adjusted.
Per the medical attendings recommendation p.m. NPH dose was
decreased to 40 units and a.m. dose of regular insulin was
held.  Other then the described hypoglycemic episode the
patient's blood sugars remained in good control.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will continue his
outpatient medications.  The insulin doses were adjusted as
described above.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1312**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6457**] in seven to ten days.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was asymptomatic,
hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  Hypoglycemia.
3.  Insulin dependent diabetes.

Date of Birth:   [**2135-2-26**]       Sex:  M

Service:  ICU/ACOVE

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Sepsis, aspiration pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old gentlemen
with end stage liver disease secondary to NASH, diabetes
mellitus, esophageal varices, status post banding, who was
recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 256**]
from [**2198-2-28**] through [**2198-3-6**] for spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis and anemia.  He was then discharged to
a skilled nursing facility where he was found to have a
change in mental status on the morning of admission ([**2198-3-9**]).  Fingerstick glucose was found to be 40.  He was given
glucagon, oral glucose and sent to [**Hospital6 4620**].
A chest x-ray there showed likely aspiration pneumonia and
fingerstick glucose was noted to be 30 with an oxygen
saturation of 77% on room air.  He was given Zosyn, put on a
nonrebreather face mask and transferred to [**Hospital1 **].  At the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room he was placed into the sepsis protocol.  He
received a total of 8 liters of intravenous fluids, 1 gram of
vancomycin.  His systolic blood pressure was in the 60s to
70s and then he was placed on a Levophed drip with increase
in the blood pressure to a systolic blood pressure to the
90s.  His temperature was noted to be 103 with course rigors.
He was oxygenating at 95% on a 15 liter nonrebreather face
mask.

The patient does not recall the events leading up to
hospitalization.  He does recall some shaking chills starting
the day prior to admission at the skilled nursing facility,
but denies any subjective fevers.  He had had some increased
diarrhea prior to admission about [**7-9**] bouts per day, baseline
2-3 times per day.  He has not been eating well secondary to
poor appetite and had a very small dinner the night prior to
admission.  In terms of his insulin regimen, he did take NPH
at his standard dose the night prior to admission and he was
noted to be ""shaking"" by the registered nurse with a
fingerstick glucose of 40 as described above.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No cough, no dry heaves, no chest
pressure, palpitations.  Positive nausea without emesis, some
mild shortness of breath.  No abdominal pain, no bright red
blood per rectum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End state liver disease secondary to non alcoholic
steatohepatitis now off of the transplant list due to lack of
social support and noncompliance with medications.  His last
Mel score was noted to be 13, despite having end stage
disease.

Baseline blood pressure from prior records was noted to be
systolic in the 90s.  Heart rate 70 and regular.  Oxygen
saturation 95% on 15 liters nonrebreather face mask.
General:  Shaking diffusely, rigoring, mild to moderate
respiratory distress at bed height angle of 30 degrees.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric, pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, moist
mucous membranes, prominent anasarca.  Neck supple,
questionable bruit on the right (? radiation of murmur).  No
lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Bilateral basilar rales at left
greater than right [**12-2**] of the way up, dullness at the left

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.3
with a differential of 82% neutrophils, 50% bands, 3%
lymphocytes, hematocrit 39.5, platelet count 94,000.  INR
1.7.  Chemistries:  Sodium 142, potassium 4.6, bicarbonate
107, BUN 26, creatinine 11, 1.1, 117.  Calcium, magnesium and
phosphorus 8.5/3.2/1.9.  AST 55, ALT 20, total bilirubin 3.9,
alkaline phosphatase 67, albumin 3.4, amylase 134, lactate

Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe atelectasis versus
consolidation.

Electrocardiogram:  Right bundle branch block with normal
sinus rhythm with an underlying sinus rhythm, unchanged
compared with prior from [**2198-1-29**].  Questionable
pseudonormalization of the T waves in V2 through V4.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially
admitted to the [**Last Name (un) 6608**] Intensive Care Unit and then
transferred to the floor on [**2198-3-10**].

1.  Sepsis:  The patient was placed on a sepsis protocol with
a goal central venous pressure of [**9-13**].  Serial lactates
were monitored.  The patient was given aggressive fluid
resuscitation.  He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone,
vancomycin and Flagyl.  Levophed was titrated to a mean
arterial pressure greater than 60.  his Lasix, Aldactone and
propanolol were held.  Blood cultures (final report) showed
no evidence of bacteremia.  The septic shock was thought to
be secondary to aspiration pneumonia, although, the chest
x-ray was significant only for mild left lower lobe
atelectasis versus consolidation.  A paracentesis was
performed and was negative for SVP.  A urinalysis was
negative for urinary tract infection.  Stool cultures,
Clostridium difficile and sputum cultures are all negative at
the time of dictation. The Levophed was weaned off on [**3-10**].  The vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl were stopped on
[**3-11**].  The patient was maintained on levofloxacin and
Flagyl for a 14 day course for aspiration pneumonia.  His
Ciprofloxacin will be continued after this course has been
completed, just once a week q. Tuesday for SVP prophylaxis.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was weaned off of Levophed as
above.  As a result of the aggressive fluid resuscitation
with his previous hypotension to the 60s, he had a resulting
non gap metabolic acidosis.  Please see below.  His Aldactone
was restarted on [**2198-3-12**] and his Lasix was restarted
as well.  These were titrated up to a dose of Lasix 40 mg po
q.d. and Aldactone 100 mg po q.d. with the patient able to
maintain normal blood pressure control.  The propanolol was
not restarted at the recommendation of the Liver Service
given the patient's lower extremity edema and only Grade 1
varices.

3.  Question of cardiac ischemia:  The patient did have some
pseudonormalization of the T waves in leads V2 through V4.
He was ruled out by enzymes for an myocardial infarction and
he had no significant events on telemetry.

4.  Hypoxia/persistent bibasilar crackles:  Despite the lung
findings, the patient did maintain adequate oxygenation
throughout his hospital course.  Though, crackles did
diminish somewhat when the Lasix and Aldactone were titrated
up.  As stated above, he will be treated with a 14 day course
of levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  There
is some question as to underlying interstitial lung disease,
but no further information is available at this time on that
speculation.

5.  Cough:  The patient did have persistent dry cough that
was somewhat controlled with Tessalon pearls and Robitussin.
It did improve after diuresis on the floor.

6.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  Initially the patient was noted
to have a hematocrit drop from 39 to 28 in the Emergency
Room.  This was felt to be likely dilutional post 7 liters of
intravenous fluid.  However, given the patient's guaiac
positive state and questionable bloody emesis in the
Emergency Room, Gastroenterology was consulted and they did
not feel that the patient had an active gastrointestinal
bleed and had only Grade 1 varices, therefore, they
recommended maintaining him on Protonix and falling
hematocrit.  The patient's hematocrit was 30.8 on [**2198-3-14**].  It did range from a nadir of 22.9 to a maximum of
39.5.  He was transfused for a hematocrit goal greater than
27.

7.  Coagulopathy:  he does have an underlying coagulopathy
secondary to hepatic dysfunction.  He was given subcutaneous
Vitamin K for a total of three days.  However, his INR was
persistently in the 1.6 to 1.8 range. Given his lack of frank
bleeding, no additional doses of Vitamin K were administered
on the floor.

8.  Change in mental status:  It is most likely that the
patient's change in mental status is secondary to
hypoglycemia.  Other considerations would be delirium versus
medications versus sepsis.  He was maintained on lactulose
t.i.d. titrated to three bowel movements a day.  He does have
a history of hyperammonemia in the past, and his ammonia
level at the time of admission was 38.  Although, this is not
a very specific finding.

9.  Decreased urine output:  Initially the patient had
decreased urine output, and there was some concern for
hepatorenal syndrome, however, after aggressive fluid
resuscitation, his urine output returned to [**Location 213**] with
greater than 1 cc/kg/hour of urine output.

10.  SVP:  The patient did have a history of SVP and a
paracentesis was performed on [**2198-3-9**] which showed no
evidence of SVP.  The acidic fluid contained 345 white blood
cells, 275 red blood cells, 6% polys, 29% lymphocytes, 23%
monocytes, 9% mesothelial cells, 33% macrophages and was felt
to be negative for SVP.  Nevertheless, as a prophylactic
measure, he will be maintained on 750 mg of Ciprofloxacin q.
week.

11.  Diabetes mellitus:  Initially the NPH and regular
insulin standing doses were held given his hypoglycemia and
mental status changes.  He was maintained on an insulin
sliding scale in house with good effect, his total insulin
requirement per day.  The patient was requiring approximately
20 units of regular insulin per day.  He will be placed on 5
units of NPH q.a.m., 5 units NPH q.p.m. with further
monitoring in the outpatient setting for effect, titrated up
as tolerated.

12.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition/metabolic acidosis:
Initially the patient had a primary metabolic acidosis likely
secondary to lactic acidosis secondary to septic shock with
compensatory respiratory alkalosis.  Following the resolution
of the patient's sepsis, he had a normal anion gap acidosis
likely secondary to aggressive fluid hydration as well as
diarrhea with a urine anion gap that was less than 12.

13.  Prophylaxis:  He was maintained on Pneumoboots while in
bed.

14.  Social support:  The patient has multiple social
stressors at home at the moment.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from Social
Work was consulted and numerous discussions were conducted
with the patient's family, both in the Intensive Care Unit
and then on the floor regarding his impending divorce, as
well as the stress of being taken off of the liver transplant
list.  At this time, the family is extremely frustrated with
the level of care that the patient requires.  He will likely
need long-term care.

15.  Goals of care:  There were numerous discussions
regarding the patient's code status and goals of care in the
Intensive Care Unit and on the floor.  The patient did at
times state that he would not want to be on a ventilator, but
then the next moment would state that he would want to be on
the ventilator.  Given the uncertainty of the patient's true
goals of care in the setting of change in mental status and
hospitalization, he was maintained as a full code throughout
his hospital stay.  It is recommended that these issues be
re-addressed in the outpatient setting when the patient is
able to think through his goals of care more clearly.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To acute rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin NPH 5 q.a.m., 5 q.p.m.
2.  Insulin sliding scale.
3.  Albuterol 1-2 puffs q. 6 hours.
4.  Zolpidem tartrate 5 mg po q.h.s. prn.
5.  Spironolactone 100 mg po q.d.  Please hold for systolic
blood pressure less than 100.
6.  Furosemide 40 mg po q.d.  Please hold for a systolic
blood pressure of less than 100.
7.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q.d. for a total 14 days with the
last dose on [**2198-3-20**].
8.  Metronidazole 500 mg po b.i.d. for a total of 14 days
with the last dose on [**2198-3-20**].
9.  Ciprofloxacin  750 mg q. week starting on [**2198-3-20**].
10. Benzonatate 100 mg po t.i.d.

per day.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Septic shock.
2.  End stage liver disease.
3.  Aspiration pneumonia.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.  He should follow-up as needed with
the Hepatology Service, however, he is no longer a candidate
for orthotropic liver transplant at this time.  The patient
should also follow-up with his primary medical doctor within
two weeks of leaving the hospital.  He is advised to inform
his doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2449**] of any confusion, chest pressure,
shortness of breath, palpitations, edema, fevers, chills,
nausea, or vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year-old
female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, asthma and
heavy alcohol use who is admitted with facial cellulitis as
well as alcohol withdraw.  The patient was well until
Thursday [**2-19**] when she awoke the following morning.  She was
feeling ill and confused.  Her roommate was concerned and he
took her to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  At that time
she started developing some pain in her face, which quickly
progressed into facial cellulitis that started spreading and
the patient became unable to open her eyes while she was in
the Emergency Department.  At that time she also reported
feeling chills and feverish since this has happened.
However, she was denying fevers or chills the day prior to
admission.  The patient denies any history of trauma.  She
has not been swimming or in any pools.  She has no pets that
could have scratched her in the face.  Otherwise she is not
complaining of any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal
pain.  No nausea or vomiting.  The patient also reports a
history of drinking heavily and the last time she had a drink
was the day prior to admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes.  2.  Hypertension.  3.
Asthma.  4.  History of alcohol abuse.  5.
Depression/anxiety.  6.  Liver cirrhosis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Klonopin 1 mg po b.i.d., Zestril
20 mg po q day, Advair one puff po b.i.d., Flovent two puffs
po b.i.d., Albuterol MDI prn, Serevent, Humulin insulin 45
units q.a.m., 30 units q.p.m., Prilosec 20 mg po q day,
Theophylline 300 mg po b.i.d. and Fluoxetine 20 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a positive history of
alcohol abuse and she continues to smoke tobacco half pack
per day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After progression of the facial cellulitis
in the Emergency Department, the patient was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was seen by
ophthalmology who felt that her examination was consistent
with preseptal bilateral cellulitis.  She had a CT scan,
which was also consistent with preseptal disease.  It also
showed some evidence of sinusitis particularly in the left
frontal, anterior ethmoid and maxillary sinuses right greater
then left.  Infectious disease was also consulted and they
suggested initial triple antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin,
Clindamycin and Levofloxacin.  Before antibiotics were
obtained blood cultures were taken as well as there were
cultures taken from several of the facial bulla as well as
her eye cultures.  She was also evaluated by plastics who
felt there was no acute issue at this time.

1.  Alcohol withdraw:  The patient began to go through
progressive withdraw throughout the first several days of her
hospital course.  She became agitated, tachycardic.  Her
mental status decreased.  She was started on Valium and a
CIWA scale and placed on thiamine and folate.

2.  Periorbital cellulitis:  She was continued on Vancomycin
and Clindamycin initially.  Levofloxacin was discontinued as
her cultures grew back beta strep group A as well as coag
positive staphylococcus, which was not differentiated at that
time.  She was eventually continued on Vancomycin alone and
then when her staph came back as being consistent with
Methacillin sensitive staph aureus she was switched to
intravenous Cephazolin and then she was changed to po Keflex.
 It was eventually decided to discharge her on a ten day
course of Dicloxacillin 500 mg po q six hours.  The patient's
facial skin became highly improved with markedly decreased
erythema and some residual hyperpigmentation across both
cheeks.

3.  Asthma:  The patient initially presented with significant
wheezing.  She was continued on her various inhalers and
nebulizers prn.  She eventually did not require the
nebulizers and her wheezing had improved and stabilized.

4.  Cardiovascular:  The patient had an episode of AVNRT
while she was in the Intensive Care Unit and she was started
on Diltiazem, however, she remained stable on telemetry with
no further events.  Because of hypotension her Diltiazem was
discontinued.  She remained on telemetry on the floor without
any further cardiac events.  She was restarted on Captopril,
which was changed to Lisinopril prior to discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Dicloxacillin 500 mg po q 6 hours
times ten days.  2.  Prozac 20 mg po q day.  3.  Lisinopril
10 mg po q day.  4.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg po t.i.d.  5.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48 year old woman with
a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, congestive heart failure,
asthma, diabetes, hypertension, pancreatitis, recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**1-28**]
to [**1-31**] for an asthma exacerbation, who now presents with
a one day history of fever, chills, nonproductive cough, sore
throat and increased wheezing.  She denies headache,
abdominal pain, dysuria or diarrhea.  She also complains of a
two week history of dyspnea on exertion with severe bilateral
lower extremity edema and increased abdominal girth.  She
denies chest pain, lightheadedness or palpitations.  She
reports low back pain secondary to abdominal girth and
tightness.  In the emergency room bedside ultrasound revealed
little ascitic fluid to tap.  In the emergency room she was
given 1 gm of Tylenol, 40 mg of IV Lasix, 500 mg of
levofloxacin p.o.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Alcoholic cirrhosis with no history of
varices.  Asthma with recent flare treated with prednisone.
Patient has just finished with her prednisone taper.
Diabetes mellitus on insulin.  Hypertension.
Anxiety/depression on Celexa.  Congestive heart failure with
an ejection fraction of 37%.  Post traumatic stress disorder.
Gastritis.  Alcoholic pancreatitis.  Status post cataract
surgery on [**2151-2-3**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d.,
Klonopin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d., Celexa 30 mg p.o. q.d., Protonix
40 mg p.o. q.d., albuterol MDI, Atrovent MDI.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She drinks about five to eight beers a day.
Has a tobacco history.  On disability.  Children live close
by.  She lives alone, but is close to her children and
grandchildren.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 102, blood pressure
115/60, heart rate 108, respiratory rate 26, 98% in room air.
She had an odor of alcohol on her breath.  She was obese,
[**Year (4 digits) 3584**], oriented times three, in no acute distress.  She had
scleral icterus with slightly dry oropharynx.  Extraocular
movements intact.  She had a left eye patch on.  Right pupil
was equally round and reactive to light.  Heart was
tachycardiac, regular rhythm without murmurs appreciated at
that time.  She had diffuse wheezing throughout her lung
exam.  Abdomen was obese with mild distension, soft,
nontender, no fluid wave appreciated, no shifting dullness
appreciated.  She had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the
knees.  She had mild asterixis, but was [**Year (4 digits) 3584**] and oriented
times three.  No hemangiomas, palmar erythema or caput medusa
were appreciated.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium was 137, potassium 4.1,
chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, BUN 7, creatinine 0.7, glucose
155.  ALT 42, AST 86, amylase 150, alkaline phosphatase 144,
LDH 424, lipase 83, total bilirubin 5.6.  White count 5.6,
hematocrit 30.1, platelets 34, 73% neutrophils, 1% bands.  PT
was 16.5, INR 1.8, PTT 34.1.  Urinalysis showed trace blood,
positive nitrite, small bilirubin 1 urobilinogen, small leuk
esterase, 21 to 50 white blood cells, 0 to 2 red blood cells,
many bacteria, no epithelial cells.  Chest x-ray showed mild
congestive heart failure.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia at
120 beats per minute, no acute ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for a urinary
tract infection and fluid overload.  Her hospital course was
long and complicated.  Patient was treated with levofloxacin
times 14 days for her urinary tract infection with negative
followup urine cultures and resolution of her fever.  She was
found to be extremely volume overloaded.  Her weight was 220
pounds in-house.  Her baseline weight, according to her
clinic notes, is 180 pounds.  It was unclear whether her
volume overload was due to cirrhosis or congestive heart
failure.  It was thought to be likely due to both.  She
received a repeat echocardiogram that showed suboptimal image
quality secondary to poor echo windows, mildly dilated left
atrium, mildly depressed left ventricular function.  Systolic
function could not be reliably assessed due to suboptimal
image.  There was trace aortic regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  Left ventricular
function was improved compared with [**2150-2-23**].  At that
time an echo showed less than 25% EF with severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis.

She was aggressively diuresed with Lasix and Aldactone.
Diuresis had to be stopped secondary to acute renal failure.
Creatinine climbed from 0.7 to a high of 3.7.  Diuretics were
stopped when creatinine was 1.2.  However, creatinine
continued to climb.  Initially a Swan-Ganz catheter was
deferred for assessment of her intravascular volume status
due to positive heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibodies.
However, with the worsening creatinine and uncertainty about
her volume status, patient was transferred to the medical
intensive care unit with a plan to place a Swan-Ganz catheter
for assessment of her volume status.  Renal consult was
called.  Her urine electrolytes and urine studies showed
pre-renal azotemia.  The renal consult team recommended
giving intravascular repletion along with packed red blood
cells for colloid repletion.  Patient responded with
resolution of her acute renal failure.

After a four day intensive care unit stay, patient was
transferred back to the floor team with continued monitoring
of her renal function.  While in the medical intensive care
unit she was positive 3.7 liters and more grossly volume
overloaded than prior to transfer to the medical intensive
care unit.  Cardiovascularly upon admission patient had
tachycardia with demand ischemia and a troponin leak of 1.1.
Subsequent troponins were done.  She was initially continued
on diltiazem for heart rate control, but diltiazem was weaned
off due to heart failure.  Hydralazine and Isordil were
started.  With resolution of her renal failure, hydralazine
and Isordil were then switched to an ACE inhibitor.  With
resolution of her acute renal failure, Lasix was also
restarted with effective diuresis.

Hospital course was also significant for alcoholic cirrhosis
with coagulopathy and encephalopathy.  Patient was continued
on lactulose for her encephalopathy.  For her coagulopathy,
she was given vitamin K without any effect.  The liver
service was consulted who recommended vitamin K and diuresis.
She also had baseline thrombocytopenia thought to be due to
both alcohol toxicity and hypersplenism.  However, during the
hospital course her platelet count continued to drop.  A
heparin induced antibody was sent off which came back
positive twice.  All heparin flushes and subcutaneous heparin
were stopped with stabilization of her platelet count.
However, Protonix was increased to b.i.d. due to trace guaiac
positive stools and hematocrit that was slowly drifting down.
Patient's platelet count continued to decrease thereafter.
Protonix was discontinued with stabilization of her platelet
count.  Two abdominal ultrasounds were obtained.  The first
one on [**2-15**] showed a mild amount of ascites, patent flow
with appropriate direction in all hepatic vessels.  A
subsequent abdominal ultrasound was obtained on [**2-25**]
showing a small amount of ascites unable to be tapped.  Due
to some complaints of abdominal discomfort, a gallbladder
scan was obtained on [**2-24**] showing no acute cholecystitis.

Her hospital course was also significant for alcohol
withdrawal for which she was on Ativan and continued on her
home regimen of Klonopin.  She was seen by the addiction
service who helped with the Ativan taper.  She was also
continued on Celexa for depression.  Patient was at time
tearful and depressed, but her mood substantially improved by
the end of her hospitalization with resolution of some of her
symptoms.

Her pulmonary status remained stable.  She was continued on
nebulizer treatments and her inhalers for asthma.  Her oxygen
saturation level remained stable throughout the hospital
stay. As mentioned above, her acute renal failure was thought
to be over-diuresis combined with poor forward flow due to
congestive heart failure.  Her hemodynamics were optimized
with an ACE inhibitor.  She was also given intravascular
repletion with packed red blood cells and normal saline in
the intensive care unit.  For her diabetes she was continued
on NPH insulin and regular insulin sliding scale.  She
complained of leg pain during the hospital course due to
edema.  Lower extremity Dopplers were negative for deep vein
thrombosis.

Her hospital course was also significant for hyperkalemia
secondary to renal failure and hyperphosphatemia.  Both were
treated with Kayexalate and Amphojel and resolved with
resolution of her acute renal failure.  Other laboratory data
from the hospital course included a vitamin B-12 level that
was normal at 1784.  Albumin was 2.4.  Thyroid stimulating
hormone was 2.0.  Digoxin level was 0.7.  Patient was started
on digoxin for her heart failure.  Alpha fetoprotein was 2.2.
She required some magnesium repletion thought due to
diuresis.  She was also hyponatremic which resolved with free
water restriction.  Over the hospital course patient received
four units of packed red blood cells with stable hematocrit
after [**3-2**].  Patient remained stable with good diuresis.
She was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that patient
required short term rehab.  Patient was discharged in stable
condition to short term rehab with the following diagnoses.

1.  Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
2.  Alcoholic cirrhosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 41 year-old
left handed gentleman without significant past medical
history who was admitted urgently on [**2145-11-4**] to the
neurology service after several episodes of focal sensory
motor seizure symptoms of the left arm and leg on the day of
admission.  MRI scan revealed a right frontal cingular gyrus
mass with intrapyranchamal hemorrhage and large surrounding
edema.  The patient was in the hospital for two days and then
discharged with follow up for surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was readmitted on [**2145-11-17**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Electrolyte abnormalities and change in
mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 41-year-old male, with a
history of renal cell cancer diagnosed in [**2145-11-1**], who
presented with seizure and found to have METS to the brain.
The patient had resection of the brain METS with residual
left hemiparesis.  He is status post stereotactic
radiosurgery on [**2145-12-15**] which was complicated by PTH
RP causing hypercalcemia, SIADH, and anxiety with recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2146-2-3**] with mental status
changes and hypercalcemia.  The patient now presented to the
clinic with electrolyte abnormalities.  On recent admission,
the patient's hypercalcemia was treated with hydration,
calcitonin and 90 mg of pamidronate on [**2146-2-18**] with
good effect.  The patient has a history of hypocalcemia after
receiving Zometa in the past, and his electrolytes were
carefully monitored.  The patient was started on Tums when
the patient's calcium fell below 9.

Since discharge, on [**2146-2-25**], the patient's labs had
been checked daily, and the patient has been on lasix prn and
Neutra-Phos, salt tablets, and Tums as needed.  Starting
[**2-28**], calcium was elevated, and the patient was told to
restart calcitonin.  Subcu injections were [**Last Name (LF) 16535**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
the patient was taking nasal spray.  Despite taking the
calcitonin, the patient's calcium continued to increase, and
was elevated to 11.7 with albumin of 2.2, with corrected
calcium of approximately 13.2.

The patient's girlfriend reported that for the past one to
two days, the patient had had increasing lack of response to
questions, and decreased strength on the left side,
decreasing appetite, and increasing lethargy.  The patient
has no history of falls, and has normal bowel movements.  The
patient has been complaining of some left-sided abdominal
pain with positive low-grade fevers since discharge to
approximately 99??????.  The patient's girlfriend was concerned
and called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**] who arranged for inpatient admission.

heart rate 108, respiration rate 16, satting 97% on room air.
The patient was generally a pleasant gentleman appearing his
stated age, in no apparent distress, and slow to respond to
questions.  The patient's sclerae were anicteric, and mucous
membranes were dry.  Examination of the heart showed that the
patient was tachycardic with regular rhythm.  S1 and S2 were
heard with no murmurs.  The patient had decreasing breath
sounds and crackles in bilateral bases.  Examination of the
back showed no CVA tenderness.  No lumbar spinal tenderness.
The patient's abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds.

plantar flexion and toe extension.

LABS:  Sodium 121, calcium 11.7, albumin 2.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine
service with change in mental status most likely due to
hypercalcemia and possible hyponatremia.  The patient's
mental status was watched by correcting the electrolyte
abnormalities.  The patient also was scheduled for
nephrectomy.  The patient's anemia was secondary most likely
to chronic disease and renal cell cancer.  The patient was
continued on Epogen.  Neuro exam showed residual left
hemiparesis from resection.  The patient has steroid induced
diabetes and was continued on fingersticks.  The patient was
put on a diabetic diet with IV fluids, and was continued to
be monitored.

On hospital day #2, the patient was put on 3% saline for
hyponatremia which the patient tolerated without any
difficulty.  The patient continued to complain of some dry
throat.  He was afebrile with stable blood pressure.  Heart
rates ran from 99-108, and taking in 260 cc PO and made 500
cc in urine.  The patient was continued to be monitored.  He
was on fluid restriction of 1,500 cc/D.  On hospital day #2,
both endocrine and renal services followed the patient,
managing electrolyte abnormalities.

On hospital #3, the patient had a right IJ placed without any
complications.  The patient remained afebrile, but continued
to be tachy at 109, otherwise doing well.  The patient's
sodium improved to 128 on treatment, and the patient was
otherwise stable.  The steroid was stopped, and the patient
was put on a house diet.  Also, the insulin was stopped.

On hospital day #4, the patient received 1 unit of blood for
a hematocrit of 25.4, and the patient's post-transfusion
hematocrit was 28.1.  The patient did not sleep well the
prior night and was more lethargic.  He remained afebrile
with stable vitals except for a heart rate at 113.  The
patient's abdomen was somewhat distended but nontender.  The
patient was preopped for the OR and was taken to the OR and
underwent a left nephrectomy for left renal mass.  The
patient was then admitted to Neuro SICU for management.  The
patient was intubated overnight and was continued on Ancef
for antibiotic.  Labs were checked to monitor the
electrolytes.

On postop day #1, the patient was continued on seizure meds
and propofol was weaned to extubate the patient.  The
patient's hemodynamics were stable, but still looked dry.
The patient's was weaned and extubated.  Chest tube was
removed.  The patient continued to be NPO with NG tube which
was removed.  The patient had decreased urine output
overnight.  The patient's IV fluid was changed to D5 1/2NS.
The patient remained afebrile, and Ancef was stopped.

On postop day #2, the patient had no complaints of pain.  He
had a soft, nontender abdomen with no erythema around the
incision.  The patient was continued on dilaudid for pain
management.  Hemodynamically, the patient was stable.  He was
started on sips.  The patient was continued on Epogen.  The
patient's A-line was removed, and the Foley was continued.

On postop day #3, the patient remained afebrile with stable
vital signs.  The patient was advanced to clear liquids and
continued on TPN.  The patient's labs were checked, and
sodium remained stable at 125 and calcium at 7.7.

On postop day #3, the patient was seen by neuro oncology who
recommended obtaining an MRI in [**2146-6-2**], and continue
current management.  On postop day #4, the patient remained
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient removed his
central line overnight which was replaced.  The patient was
continued on sodium tablets for treatment of hyponatremia.
On postop day #5, the patient was changed to PO pain meds.
The patient was put on fluid restriction and continued sodium
tablets for SIADH.

On postop day #6, the patient had emesis overnight, but the
nausea had improved with Zofran.  The patient had no
appetite.  The patient remained afebrile with tachys to 119,
otherwise with stable vital signs.  The patient was put on IV
fluids and continued on sodium tablets.  Magnesium was
repleted.  On postop day #7, the patient had no complaints of
nausea, vomiting, fever, chills.  The patient stated that he
had had flatus.  He remained afebrile with heart rate still
at 104 with the rest of the vitals remaining stable.  The
patient was alert and interactive.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  The wound had no erythema.  The
patient's sodium was stable at 129.  Free calcium was stable
at 119.  Otherwise, the patient was doing well.

The patient was seen by physical therapy and walked with

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from outside hospital for
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to treat
common bile duct stone.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year-old severely
mentally retarded male who is quadriplegic and blind who was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital **] Hospital
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] here at [**Hospital1 69**] for
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to treat a
1 cm common bile duct stone.  A brief summary of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course at [**Location (un) **] is as follows; the
patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2168-8-16**] after
developing nausea, vomiting and fever to 101 degrees.  In the
Emergency Department there he was tachycardic, tachypneic and
febrile with a distended abdomen.  At that time the patient
was found to be in atrial fibrillation at 127 beats per
minute.  His INR was found to be supratherapeutic and his
Coumadin was initially held.  The patient was also found to
have no output through his ileostomy and a plain film of the
abdomen showed air filled large and small bowel proximal to
the descending colon raising the question of a bowel
obstruction.  A CT scan showed an edematous gallbladder with
wall thickening and a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed
a possible stone at the base of the gallbladder with dilation
of the duct to 1 cm.  The patient was placed on Levaquin and
Clindamycin at this time.  The patient also experienced
respiratory failure after having a great deal of difficulty
with secretion clearance, he desaturated further requiring a
nonrebreather mask and at that time a chest x-ray showed
complete opacification of the left hemithorax.  At that time
the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at
[**Hospital **] Hospital, briefly intubated after discussions with
the patient's brother [**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures were negative at
that time.  Over the next several days his respiratory status
improved and the patient was continued on 40% aerosol mask.
The patient eventually underwent MRCP at [**Hospital **] Hospital
revealing 1 cm common bile duct stone.  At this time the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation with an EF in the 50s.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction.
3.  Severe mental retardation.
4.  Quadriplegia.
5.  Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.
6.  Hepatitis B carrier.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8.  Hiatal hernia.
9.  Kyphosis.
10.  PEG tube.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg and 5.5 mg alternating days.
2.  Lopresor 12.5 mg twice a day.
3.  Protonix q day.
4.  simethicone prn.

ALLERGIES:  Nystatin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been in the care of the
state for sometime.  His brother [**Name (NI) **] is his health care
proxy.  The brother has designated that the patient's code
status shall be DNR/DNI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.1.  Heart
rate 63.  [**Name (NI) **] pressure 134/48.  Oxygen saturation 96% on
face tent 80%.  General lying in bed in no acute distress.
HEENT no rash or icterus.  Lungs limited air movement, low
bronchial sounds.  Heart S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with
hyperactive bowel sounds with no rebound or guarding.
Extremities contracted extremities without clonus.
Neurological nonverbal quadriplegic.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White [**Name (NI) **] cell 10.8, hematocrit
37.4, platelets 276, INR 1.3, sodium 143, potassium 3.9, BUN
13, creatinine 0.6, glucose 68, AST 42, ALT 62, alkaline
phosphatase 138, bili 1.3, amylase 77.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 66 year-old severely mentally
retarded quadriplegic blind male with multiple medical
problems including atrial fibrillation who is admitted to the
[**Hospital1 69**] FIU from an outside
hospital for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
and common bile duct stone removal.

1.  Common bile duct obstruction:  The patient was kept NPO
prior to the procedure and underwent an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography on [**2168-8-25**].  A biliary
sphinchterotomy was performed.  The 1 cm stone was extracted
and the bile duct was subsequently swept with a balloon
catheter and an occlusion cholangiogram revealed no further
concretion in the bile duct.  The patient was continued on
Unasyn intravenously for several days.  The patient was kept
NPO after the procedure and tube feeds were gradually
restarted in the a.m.  The patient will return to [**Last Name (un) 17317**]
State on a seven day course of Augmentin.  The patient can
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17318**] as needed.

2.  Bowel obstruction/ileus:  In the end the patient was felt
likely to have an ileus relating to irritation from the
common bile duct stone.  At no time did he appear toxic with
respect to his gastrointestinal tract.  He tolerated the
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure
well. On [**8-26**] he was gradually restarted on his tube
feedings.

3.  Pneumonia:  It is unclear whether the patient had a
pneumonia at [**Hospital **] Hospital or whether he acutely desated
from mucous plug requiring intubation.  He received
antibiotic coverage there for a pneumonia, however, this was
not continued at [**Hospital1 69**].  Here
he sated in the high 90s on 40% face tent.  He did
occasionally desat, but responded to aggressive suctioning.
It is likely that his oxygen requirement will go down as he
recovers from the acute insult of both the common bile duct
stone and the sedating medication used during the procedure.


4.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient apparently has had
several episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past with
rates to the 120s.  At [**Hospital1 69**]
the patient was well controlled on Lopressor 25 b.i.d.,
however, he did appear to remain in atrial fibrillation.
Recommend continuation of this previously effected and well
tolerated medication.  The patient's anticoagulation was held
for his endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
procedure.  On [**8-26**] the patient was restarted on his home
doses of Coumadin to bring his INR back up into the
therapeutic range of 2.02 to 3.0.  Given the patient's
reported history of an myocardial infarction the patient may
benefit from a baby aspirin a day and also from an ace
inhibitor.

5.  Dermatology:  On [**8-25**] the patient was noted to have a
macular red beefy lesions in his groin, thought to be
candidiasis.  The patient was started on Clotrimazole cream
b.i.d.

6.  Nutrition:  On [**8-26**] the patient was restarted on gentle
tube feeding with his goal to be 60 cc per hour of Osmolite
HN as he was on at [**Last Name (un) 17317**] State.

7.  Code status:  During this hospitalization the patient's
brother [**Name (NI) **] decided it would be appropriate for the
patient's code status to be DNR/DNI.  This was briefly waved
both for his acute intubation at [**Hospital **] Hospital as well as
for the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
procedure.

This concludes dictation on this patient for the dates
[**2168-8-24**] through [**2168-8-26**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass grafting nine years and
PTCA and stenting of the right coronary artery, diabetes
mellitus, cervical disease, status post effusion, who has
been on chronic narcotics, who presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] for catheterization.

He was transferred to the CCU for management of congestive
heart failure.  He presented to the outside hospital with
decreased mental status.  He had a negative head CT.  He also
had acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.8, shortness
of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  He had been on OxyContin
60 q.d. for chronic cervical pain at the outside hospital and
initially received Narcan.  He was diuresed empirically and
treated for bronchitis and Ceftriaxone.  Chest x-ray showed
no evidence of pneumonia but did show some mild congestive
heart failure.

On [**3-18**], the patient had a repeat change in mental status
with an oxygen desaturation to 82%.  Chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  He was diuresed with Lasix,
received Nitroglycerin drip and Nutracort.  He also had a
slight elevation in troponin to 0.26.  He had a positive
Dobutamine stress test for posterolateral defect that was
reversible.

He was sent to [**Hospital6 256**] for
catheterization.  He had a cardiac output was 5.1, cardiac
index of 2.26.  Pulmonary capillary pressures were with a
mean of 39, PA pressure of 58/26, showing elevated filling
pressures, and mean pulmonary capillary wedge of 37%, PAD of
40, severe pulmonary hypertension.  Oxygenation was marginal,
and pCO2 was elevated.  The numbers improved with
Nitroglycerin and Lasix.  The patient received 100 IV Lasix
with 2 L negative diuresis.  Also in catheterization lab,
LMCA had a 40% distal lesion supplying the ramus intermedius.
Left anterior descending was occluded.  The left circumflex
was occluded.  Right coronary artery was occluded.  The OM2 was
occluded and fills
by collaterals.  This is a change from catheterization in
[**2155**].  SVG to PDA with 40% PDA origin stenosis and 20% mid
stenosis, LIMA to LDA was patent with a 50% touchdown
stenosis.  Filling defects seemed possibly due to a string or
suture.  Unchanged from prior catheterization in [**2155**].

distress.  He was lying flat in bed.  HEENT:  Extraocular
movements intact.  Anicteric.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Moist mucous membranes.  Heart:  Regular,
rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  There was a 1/6 systolic
ejection murmur over the precordium.  No jugular venous
distention appreciated secondary to anatomy and patient's
position.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.

As stated earlier at the outside hospital, the had a myoview
Dobutamine stress test with anterior fixed defects,
posterolateral wall reversible defect, ejection fraction of
25-30%, 29% maximum heart rate, dilated left ventricular
cavity.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus at 96, normal axis,
PR prolonged, normal QRS and QTC, poor R-wave progression,
and evidence of previous anterior myocardial infarction.

CT of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and large
mediastinal lymph nodes, 2.5 cm and 2 x 1 cm on the other
side.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 72-year-old male with a past
medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension,
chronic renal failure, 25-30%, who presented from the outside
hospital for catheterization status post positive Dobutamine
stress test who was found to be in congestive heart failure.

1.  Cardiovascular/CHF:  He was initially placed on
Nitroglycerin drip and received 100 IV Lasix with
approximately 2 L output.  He was then placed on a Nutracort
drip, and Nitroglycerin drip was discontinued.  He had a
further 3.5 L negative for his hospital stay.  On the day of
discharge, he was roughly actually 6 L negative, and 92% in
room air.

He was started on an ACE inhibitor, being titrated up to
Captopril 25 t.i.d. on the day of discharge.  Imdur was also
started on the day of discharge, at 30 p.o. q.d.

On the 31st, the patient developed ..................., and
Nutracort drip was stopped.  Acetazolamide 250 q.d. was
added, and his bicarb dropped from 35 to 33.  The patient's
beta-blocker was initially held due to acute congestive heart
failure, and was restarted on the day of discharge.

The patient was placed on Bumex initially 2 IV b.i.d. and
then converted to 2 p.o. b.i.d.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient had
no intervention on his cardiac catheterization.  There were
no lesions that could be intervened.  He was continued on
Aspirin, metoprolol 25 b.i.d.  Again his ACE inhibitor was
restarted; initially we waited a few days after this to see how
his kidneys would do after this in view of  acute renal failure
at the outside
hospital.  His creatinine was stable throughout his stay
here, and in fact was 0.7-0.1.  He was in normal sinus rhythm
with no events on telemetry.

He was placed on sliding scale Humalog with good glucose
control.  He will be discharged on his regular Insulin and
NPH Insulin as he goes to rehabilitation with sliding scale
for tight control.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient remained afebrile during
his hospital stay.  Cultures were negative.

4.  Pulmonary:  The patient was placed on a Solu-Medrol
inhaler.  He was also treated with nebs p.r.n.  Given the CAT
scan and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, he will need to be
followed.  This will be communicated to his cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 27082**] to have follow-up CAT scan.

5.  Cervical disease:  The patient is status post fusion.
The patient was continued on Methadone 10 p.o. b.i.d. which
was started at the outside hospital.  He seems to have good
pain control.  The patient was continued on Protonix 40 p.o.
q.d. and required bowel regimen for constipation given the
Methadone; this included Senna, Colace and Lactulose p.r.n.

6.  Depression:  The patient was continued on his Paxil
prophylaxis.  The patient was placed on subcue Heparin,
pneumoboots.  He was seen by Physical Therapy who thought he
would benefit from a stay in [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation to
improve mobility, balance and gait performance.

7. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient his
potassium monitored given the extensive diuresis, and he was
repleted.  He was on a cardiac-diabetic diet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Glaucoma.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting, status post percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Chronic cervical stenosis.
6.  Chronic narcotic dependence.
7.  Depression.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 25 p.o. b.i.d., Imdur 30
p.o. q.d., .................. 2 p.o. b.i.d., Captopril 25
p.o. t.i.d., ................... 30 mg p.o. q.d.,

Ecotrin coated 325 mg p.o. q.d., ................ 250 p.o.
q.d., this may be discontinued when the patient's bicarb is
less than or equal to 30, Solu-Medrol 1-2 puffs inhaled
b.i.d., Albuterol 1-2 puffs inhaled q.6 hours p.r.n.
shortness of breath, Insulin 5 U q.a.m., regular 12 U q.p.m.
NPH with sliding scale of Humalog Insulin, Xalatan drops O.U.
b.i.d.,, Alphagan drops, O.U. t.i.d., ............... drops
O.U. h.s., Colace 1 tab p.o. b.i.d., Senna 1 tab p.o. q.d.,
Lactulose 30 cc p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n.

This medication will most likely be amended as this is being
dictated prior to the patient's discharge.  An addendum will
be added regarding final list of discharge medications.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to have a follow-up appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27082**] on Thursday, [**2166-4-14**]:15 a.m. to modify
his medication regimen to optimize his congestive heart
failure as an outpatient, as well as to follow-up on the CT
findings.

98.2, heart rate 85, blood pressure 142/72, respiratory rate
20, O2 sat 96% on 2 liters.  In general, in no acute
distress.  HEENT pupils equally round and reactive to light.
OP clear.  Mucous membranes moist.  Neck no JVD.  Chest clear
to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles.  Heart sounds
regular rate and rhythm, sounds distant, no murmurs, gallops
or rubs.  Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender, normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities with 1+ edema on the dorsal aspect
of the left foot.  No ankle edema.  Dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial 2+ pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.3, hematocrit 31.2, platelets
241.  PT 12.5, PTT 37.7, INR 1.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.7,
chloride 107, CO2 27, BUN 18, creatinine 0.7, glucose 99.  CK
44, troponin 0.03.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was followed by the medicine
service upon admission to [**Hospital1 188**].  On [**5-9**] she was brought to the cath lab.  Please
see the cath report for full details.  In summary, the cath
showed left main 40% to 50%, LAD 95% at proximal edge of
patent LAD stent, left circumflex 95% lesion, RCA with
diffuse luminal irregularities.  At that time CT surgery was
consulted and patient was consented for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  Prior to going to the operating room,
patient underwent carotid Doppler exams which showed no
significant lesions in either the right or the left carotid
arteries.

On [**5-11**] the patient was brought to the operating room.
Please see the operative report for full details.  In
summary, patient had coronary artery bypass grafting times
four with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM2, saphenous
vein graft to diag sequentially to OM1.  She tolerated the
operation well and was transferred from the operating room to
the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.  At the time of
transfer patient's mean arterial pressure was 72, CVP 15.
She was AV paced at 80 beats per minute.  She had epinephrine
0.03 mcg per kg per minute and propofol 10 mcg per kg per
minute.  Additionally, patient was on milrinone 0.25 mcg per
kg per minute.  In the immediate postoperative period patient
was kept sedated and ventilated as she was hemodynamically
unstable with labile blood pressure and cardiac index which
resolved with the initiation of milrinone and additional
volume in the immediate postoperative period.  Additionally,
patient had mild respiratory acidosis.

On the morning of postoperative day one the patient was
hemodynamically stable.  She was weaned from milrinone.
Sedation was discontinued.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  Later in the day of
postoperative day one patient was begun on small doses of
Lopressor secondary to tachycardia.  However, with the
initiation of Lopressor, she displayed complete heart block
which required temporary pacing.  Several hours later patient
recovered her sinus rhythm and remained hemodynamically
stable throughout this period.  On the morning of
postoperative day three patient's PA catheter, chest tubes
and Foley catheter were discontinued and she was transferred
from the cardiothoracic intensive care unit to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Once the floor, with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapist, patient activity level was increased.
Over the next several days her Lopressor dose was gradually
increased until on postoperative day five it was decided that
patient was stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and
rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer, the patient's physical exam was as
follows.  Vital signs temperature 98.4, heart rate 110 sinus
tach, blood pressure 142/80, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 92%
in room air.  Weight preoperatively 69.9 kg, at discharge
76.4 kg.  Lab data white count 10.5, hematocrit 35.7,
platelets 214.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.4, chloride 97, CO2
34, BUN 27, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121.  Alert and oriented
times three.  Moved all extremities.  Followed commands.
Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 with no murmurs.  Sternum was
stable.  Incision with staples open to air clean and dry.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with 1+
edema bilaterally.  Left leg incision with staples.  Small
amount of serosanguineous fluid draining from the upper pole
of that incision.

History of Present Illness:
77 year old female with DM, COPD, CAD s/p CABG [**2101**], angina and
abnormal stress test at OSH with worsening EF on [**1-3**] presents
for cardiac catheterization.  Patient's cardiac history includes
a silent MI about 15 yrs ago, CP and dyspnea with MI in [**2101**],
s/p CABGx4 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5296**].  Patient was diagnosed with DM 2 days
prior to admission with blood sugar 300.  Pt was admitted to OSH
last week with CHF.  She was admitted again on [**1-7**] with CHF, BNP
1760, ruled out for MI.  At OSH patient noted to have worsening
EF and she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  Patient states she
had CP at rest 5 days prior for 10 minutes and overnight that
night woke up short of breath without CP.  Patient denies
orthopnea.  She has had increasing lower extremity swelling in
the past 4 days and does get short of breath with activity (she
has had PFTs at [**Location (un) **] in past).
     During catheterization patient had an episode of CP,
increased PCWP and hypotension when balloon was inflated, but
this resolved when balloon was deflated.  A small vessel was
perforated and Echo performed but no effusion seen.

[**2104-1-8**] CARDIAC Catheterization
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel native coronary artery disease. Patent SVG-OM3.
Occluded
proximal SVG-D1-OM2 with patent D1-OM2 jump segment. Atretic
LIMA-LAD.
2. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. PCI of LAD with DES.
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native
two
vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant
circulation. The
LMCA had mild disease without flow limitation. The LAD was
heavily
calcified proximally with serial 80% and 90% stenoses in the mid
and
distal vessel. The diagonal had a jump segment of vein graft
that filled
an occluded OM. The LCX had a 50% proximal stenosis. The OM1 was
without
flow limiting disease. The OM2 and OM3 were totally occluded.
The OM2
filled via the jump segment from the diagonal. The OM3 filled
via a
patent vein graft. The RCA had mild luminal irregularities
without flow
limiting disease.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated the SVG-OM3 to be widely
patent. The
SVG-D1-OM2 was totally occluded in the proximal graft with a
patent jump
segment supplying the OM2 via the native diagonal.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated an atretic LIMA-LAD
with
minimal flow into the LAD.
4. Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart
catheterization
demonstrated elevated right and left filling pressures
(RVEDP=15mmHg,
PCWP=20mmHg, LVEDP=20mmHg). Cardiac output and index were
preserved at
4.9 L/min and 2.8 L/min/m2. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension
was
present.
5. Left ventriculography was not performed to reduce contrast
load.
6. PCI of LAD with DES.
.
Echocardiogram [**2104-1-9**]:
EF 20%.  The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with relative preservation
of the basal lateral and distal lateral walls and near akinesis
of remaining segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation. No pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2031**] was an 81 year old woman with history of CAD s/p
multiple MIs, CABG 4v, presented to outside hospital with new
lung mass, post obstructive pneumonia, who subsequently
developed chest pain after albuterol nebulization treatment and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for concern
of acute coronary syndrome.

#Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient was hemodynamically stable
on presentation to the CCU, requiring 4L O2 by NC.  CXR showed a
likely large lung mass in the right lung field.  An ABG showed
the patient had a large A-a gradient.  The patient had
intermittend hypoxic episodes that became increasingly frequent
associated with chest pain.  There was concern for PE, and
heparin was started.  Antibiotics were started as well for a
post-obstructive pneumonia.  Lasix was given for possible CHF
exacerbation, and nebulizers and methylprednisolone was given
for possible COPD exacerbation.

Despite these measures, the patient however continued to
deteriorate rapidly and she became delirious.  The family was
[**Name (NI) 653**], who indicated that the primary goal of the patient
and the family was comfort.  A family meeting was held, and the
patient all interventions with the exception of comfort measures
were discontinued.  A morphine drip was started, and the patient
expired on [**2108-2-22**] at 3:15pm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
female with a history of refractory hypertension, PMR,
temporal arteritis on chronic prednisone who has been
complaining of dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath and
orthopnea for many months.  Work up in [**Month (only) 956**] by
essentially normal left ventricular ejection fraction.  The
patient presented after having increasing shortness of
breath.  Her husband called EMS 30 minutes after symptoms
began.  EMS found patient very lethargic in obvious
respiratory distress, unable to reply whether she was
experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness,
headache or nausea/vomiting.  Vitals at that time showed a
respiratory rate of 32.  The patient was taken to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department and
intubated with pulmonary edema.  The patient was then taken
to catheterization and found to have severely compromised
left ventricular function with apical dyskinesis and inferior
hypokinesis.  O2 saturation was showed to have a significant
stepup which was confirmed two times.  Her SVC saturation was
55.  Her PA saturation was 80 on first trial.  On second
trial, SVC was 54 and PA saturation was 72%.  A transthoracic
echocardiogram done in the lab at that time was unable to
demonstrate a VFD.  Intervention was deferred at the time and
the patient was sent to CCU for TEE.  Angiography at catheter
lab demonstrated a diseased LAD with focal disease, but
TIMI-3 flow.  When the patient presented to catheter lab, she
was initially hypertensive with a blood pressure of 215/160,
but precipitously dropped her blood pressure when
nitroglycerin was started.  The patient responded rapidly to
dopamine and patient came to the CCU receiving dopamine.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO CCU:  The patient was on vent

phosphorus 7.4, magnesium 2.2.  Initial CPK was 93, troponin
less than 0.3.  Arterial blood gases was pH 7.34, PCO2 46,
PO2 356.  Her chest x-ray showed prominent right central
pulmonary vasculature and right perihilar opacity.  TEE
showed no intracardiac shunt or VSD.  Interatrial septum
intact.  Mild thick mitral valve with trace mitral
regurgitation, no aortic insufficiency, mild tricuspid
regurgitation.  LV systolic function severely impaired with
septal akinesis, apical dyskinesis and anterior akinesis, mid
to distal inferior akinesis.  RV free wall motion was
preserved.  Subsequent CPKs were flat with a peak at 116 and
an MB peak of 9, however troponin rose to 7.5.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Polymyalgia rheumatica
3.  Temporal arteritis confirmed by temporal artery biopsy
showing giant cells

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 5 mg
2.  Labetalol 100 mg tid
3.  Vasotec 40 mg
4.  Premarin
5.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Six year of smoking over 30 years ago, no
alcohol use.  Retired, worked in the Chemistry Lab at [**Hospital3 28333**] [**Hospital3 **].  The patient is from [**Country 28334**].

HOSPITAL MEDICATIONS:  She was started on Integrilin briefly,
but stopped in the catheterization lab, intravenous heparin,
aspirin and dopamine drip.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be
described systematically.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has significant coronary
artery disease with diseased LAD 80% occlusion.  She was
continued on intravenous heparin and started on aspirin and
Lipitor.  The patient was started on Lopressor and titrated
up during the course of the hospital stay to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She
was also started on ACE inhibitor, captopril which was
titrated up to 50 mg tid and later she was switched to
lisinopril 40 mg qd.

During the course of her hospital stay, she had one episode
of near syncope and had nausea and vomiting.
Electrocardiogram at that time showed flipped Ts in the
anterior leads suggestive of ischemia.  The patient was
treated with nitroglycerin and had resolution of symptoms.
The patient was re-catheterized on [**6-15**].  Catheter
findings showed LMCA with 30% occlusion, diffuse disease, LAD
with 70% stenosis at the bifurcation of the large diagonal,
distal LAD small and diffusely diseased and left circumflex
with mild diffuse disease.

Intervention at the time was dilation and stenting of the LAD
with 2.75 x 23 mm BX Hepacoat stent.  It showed normal reflow.
After the procedure, the patient denied any chest pain or
nausea/vomiting.  She had no bleeding from her femoral sheath
and had no elevation of CPKs.  The patient was started on
Integrilin for which she took for 18 hours post
catheterization procedure.  She will be placed on Plavix and
aspirin.  Aspirin she will take long term.  Plavix she will
take 75 mg for the 30 days.  The patient will require long
term anticoagulation due to her dyskinesis in her anterior
wall.  However, while she is taking Plavix and aspirin,
anticoagulation will be withheld due to increased risk of
bleeding.

2.  PUMP:  The patient had severe left ventricular
dysfunction on echocardiogram.  She was initially on
dopamine, but was able to be weaned off.  She was in
pulmonary edema on admission to the Emergency Room, but was
diuresed effectively in the Emergency Department and on the
floor chest x-ray revealed resolution of pulmonary edema and
PA diastolic in the catheterization lab was measured at 14.
Therefore, further diuretics at the time were withheld.
echocardiography  showed no signs of left to right shunting to
explain the oxygen stepoff, however revealed anterior lateral
near akinesis with apical dyskinesis.  With this finding, the
patient will likely require long term anticoagulation for
stroke prophylaxis.

During the course of admission, the patient had continued
shortness of breath.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to
evaluate possibility of worsening congestive heart failure.
However, initial Swan-Ganz readings had a capillary wedge
pressure of 19, a CVP of 10 and a cardiac index of 2.23.
Therefore, congestive heart failure was deemed unlikely and
further diuretics were not given.  The patient developed a
right bundle branch block transiently during placement of
Swan-Ganz catheter, however this resolved by morning.  The
patient had significant ectopy during the course of her
admission, often having PVBCs, however by the end of her
hospital course, she was having very few PVCs.  Further EP
study was deemed unnecessary at this time.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced.  He quit smoking
cigarettes in [**2125**].  He occasionally drinks alcohol.  He
walks with a cane.  He currently is living with his parents.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complains of a 20 pound
weight loss (168 to 147 pounds) since [**2158-9-12**],
secondary to a decreased appetite and frequent nausea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 98.9,
pulse 60, respirations 16, blood pressure 192/80, oxygen
saturation equals 97 percent on room air, height 5 feet 9
inches, weight 148.5 pounds.  Neck:  No jugulovenous
distension.  Chest:  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with
II/VI systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal
border.  Lungs clear bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Scaphoid,
nontender, bowel sounds present.  Kidney, in the right iliac
fossa not palpable.  Extremities:  Dry gangrene of the tip of
the right and left second finger is present.  Left upper
extremity had a thrombosed arteriovenous fistula and another
functioning fistula with a thrill and bruit.  Left foot has
ischemic toe changes with rubor from the toes to the dorsum
of the foot.  No ulcers on either foot.  Pulse examination:
Carotids palpable bilaterally with bruits versus transmitted
cardiac murmurs.  Radial artery is 2+ on the right and
nonpalpable on the left.  Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
Pedal pulses all have doppler signals.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory data revealed white
blood cell count 3.8, hemoglobin 11.8, hematocrit 36.4,
platelets 214,000, PT 13.2, PTT 28.3, INR 1.2.  Sodium 141,
potassium 5.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 33, BUN 29,
creatinine 5.6, glucose 121, calcium 9.4, phosphorus 5.1,
magnesium 1.7.  Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm at a
rate of 66.  Atrial premature complex present.  Left
ventricular hypertrophy by voltage.  His previous tracing of
[**2155-10-30**] revealed sinus bradycardia is absent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2160-2-20**], following hemodialysis in the morning.  He
was empirically started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  The Renal
Service managed the patient's hemodialysis on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.  They withheld the Imuran until follow
up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in three to four weeks
following discharge from the hospital.  A 24 hour urine was
collected and creatinine, urea, and protein was reportedly
within normal limits.  Preoperatively the patient's left foot
pain was difficult to manage.  The Dilaudid was not helpful.
Toradol was more helpful.

On [**2160-2-28**], the patient underwent an uneventful
below-the-knee popliteal to both posterior tibial bypass
grafts with nonreverse saphenous vein.  At the end of surgery
the patient had a warm left foot with palpable graft and
doppler signals at the pedal pulses.

The patient had a PCA postoperatively for pain control which
was unsatisfactory.  The Acute Pain Service was consulted and
recommended Oxycontin 10 mg p.o. t.i.d., Oxycodone for
breakthrough pain, and Nortriptyline 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.  This
regimen was helpful in controlling the patient's foot pain.

Plastic Surgery was consulted regarding the patient's
gangrenous fingertips.  They recommended continuing Silvadene
treatment, continuing the patient's calcium channel blocker,
and magnetic resonance angiography of the upper extremities.
The magnetic resonance angiography was done on [**2160-3-3**]
and results are pending at the time of dictation.  Further
follow up or possible surgery in the future will be made with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Plastic Surgery.

The patient finished a ten day course of intravenous Zosyn
and Vancomycin.  Antibiotics were discontinued on [**2160-3-3**].

At the time of dictation, the patient's left leg incision is
clean and intact with only a minimal amount of serous
drainage from the distal incision.  The distal surgical
staples were removed on [**2160-3-3**].  The remaining
surgical staples in the incision will be removed in about
three weeks following surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
office.  The bypass graft is palpable and the dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses have doppler signals.

During the course of admission, the patient's blood sugars
were erratic.  The [**Last Name (un) **] Consult Service did not manage the
patient's insulin requirements because the patient insisted
that he was capable of managing his insulin.  He frequently
refused to take his bedtime dose of 40 units of 70/30
insulin.  His blood sugars were very erratic but the patient
insisted that he manage his own insulin requirements.

Physical therapy evaluated the patient for full weightbearing
ambulation.  [**Hospital **] rehabilitation stay was advised.

While the patient was on antibiotic therapy he developed very
loose stools.  Clostridium difficile cultures times two were
negative.  The patient ascribed his diarrhea to taking
Vancomycin.  After the negative Clostridium difficile
studies, Loperamide was ordered prn.  Within 24 hours, the
patient had formed stool and no longer required Loperamide.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies drinking, denies alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Generally, the patient
appears exhausted but is not in acute distress.  Chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is regular
rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are significant
for a right lower extremity with dry gangrene of the third
toe, adjacent erythematous change of the second and fourth
toes.  Tender to palpation, especially over the plantar
surface.  There is significant malodor, but no obvious
purulent discharge.  Palpable right posterior tibial.  The
left foot looks relatively healthy, with a palpable left
posterior tibial and graft pulses.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  CBC 10.9/38.0/404.  Chemistry
133/5.9/86/34/49/6.6/211.  Lactate is 2.0.

RADIOLOGY ON ADMISSION:  Right foot x-ray demonstrates no
obvious osteomyelitis or subcutaneous air in the right foot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for antibiotics to
treat his right foot cellulitis.  He was evaluated for
potential amputation, and also given hemodialysis.  On
[**2161-1-29**], the patient was brought to the operating room and
had a right third toe ray amputation and debridement
performed.  For details of this, please see the previously
dictated operative note.  Subsequent to this, the patient had
a fairly [**Male First Name (un) 3928**] postoperative course complicated by what was
thought to be torsades [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 29185**].  Cardiology was
consulted, and they felt that the offending factor was likely
the large dose of methadone that he was one, which can
lengthen the QT interval.  The patient was transferred to the
intensive care unit for close monitoring.  Cardiology
consultation service was obtained.  The torsades which was
encountered perioperatively required direct cardioversion.
Subsequent to this, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was prolonged
primarily due to volume overload requiring hemodialysis, as
well as infectious disease workup.  The patient had had high
fevers and was treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
Flagyl under the guidance of the infectious disease consult
service.  Ultimately the patient had no significant blood
cultures.  He did, however, have wound swab which upon
initial presentation grew out coag negative staph as well as
E. coli.  Repeat foot swab on [**2161-2-11**] demonstrated C. albicans
as well as coag negative staph.  The patient had no
significant blood cultures.  Though he had some fever issues
and was followed by the infectious disease consult service,
ultimately the workup demonstrated no obvious source within
the foot.  Ultimately, the patient was discharged home,
having been afebrile for 48 hours and with a normal white
count.  The patient also had a history of dry gangrene and
necrosis of his fingertips, for which the plastic surgery
service was consulted.  They felt there was no need to do
emergent surgery.

DISPOSITION:  To home with [**Date Range 269**] and physical therapy.  Diet is
1800 calorie diabetic diet.

MEDICATIONS:  Vitamin C, B complex and folic acid capsule 1
daily.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is a 48 yo male with PVD, ESRD on HD, currently
undergoing treatment for c. difficile found by his VNA with
diarrhea, fatigued, BPs in 80's and down to 60's while standing.
 He was reported to have intermittent altered mental status.  He
was sent to [**Hospital3 7362**] where T 97, HR 68, RR 16, BP 83/52,
SpO2 100%.  He was found to have WBC 15.1 with 35% bands,
lactate 2.0.  He received NS 500 cc, IV azithromycin 500 mg IV
and rocephin 1 gram IV, as empiric therapy for possible
infiltrate on CXR.  He was started on a dopamine drip for SBP
persistently in the 70's for approximately two hours.

He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED via [**Location (un) **] on a dopamine
drip.  In our ED, T 100, HR 80, BP 101/42, RR 16, SpO2 100% on
NRB.  RIJ was placed. Patient received 2L NS, vancomycin 1 gram
IV, and dopamine gtt was transitioned to leveophed gtt.  On
examination in ED, patient was reported to be confused and
somnolent, requiring sternal rub to arouse. When aroused,

Pertinent Results:
.
EKG: sinus rhythm, rate 80, normal axis, normal intervals.  +
1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1-V3, also seen on prior EKG dated
[**2163-12-4**].
.
CXR [**2-23**]:  Lung volumes are now quite low with new patchy
opacity at the right more than left lung base, likely
atelectasis.  Allowing for this, the heart size and pulmonary
vessels are likely within normal limits, and there is no
significant pleural effusion.
.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2-23**]:
1.  Moderate ascites may be secondary to third spacing, but can
also be seen secondary to more significant pathologies.  Bowel
ischemia cannot be excluded.
2.  Moderately distended gallbladder.  Acalculous cholecystitis

Date of Birth:   [**2153-3-25**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old woman with
a history of hypertension and transferred from an outside
hospital for evaluation of chest pain.  The pain started two
weeks prior to admission abdomen was seen in the emergency
department for burning chest pain that started substernally
and radiated up to her jaw with shortness of breath and
one-block dyspnea on exertion.  The patient was given a GI
cocktail that relieved her pain and was sent home with
Nexium.  The patient reports that she continued to have
multiple episodes of this sharp burning pain rated at 7 out
of 10.

The patient returned to the outside hospital for further
evaluation where labs were drawn and CK was found to be 391,
CK/MB 57, troponin-I 3.92.  EKGs showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions
in the lateral leads, Q-wave in III and the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further evaluation and
elective catheterization.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient became hypotensive
requiring IV fluids and a dopamine drip.  She was taken to
the cath lab where an RCA total occlusion was found, filling
distally via collaterals.  The RCA was successfully stented
and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further
observation.

Coronary artery disease risk factors include family history,
smoking one pack per day for 24 years, hyperlipidemia and
obesity.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Gastroesophageal reflux disease,
asthma, sciatica and chronic back pain, degenerative
arthritis in the lower spine and glomerular sclerosis,
apparently diagnosed through proteinuria.

ALLERGIES:  Tetracycline, sulfa, Demerol and Lopid, all of
which have unknown reactions, and aspirin which causes asthma
attacks.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  According to patient, include:  Univasc
30 mg b.i.d., [**Last Name (un) 32852**] 80 mg q. day, Pravachol 40 mg q. day,
Tricor 54 mg q. day, amitriptyline 10 mg q.h.s., trazodone 50
mg q.h.s., Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d., Benadryl 50 mg q. day,

Serevent 50 two puffs t.i.d., Flexeril 10 mg t.i.d.,
urecholine 25 mg b.i.d., Nexium 40 mg q. day, Humibid 600 mg
q. day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with emphysema, mother with lung
cancer, brother with lung cancer.

PERTINENT LABS:  CKs peaked at 1069 on [**7-17**].  The
patient was pain-free after cath with the exception of her
chronic pain which was well managed.  The patient was aspirin
allergic so it was determined to give her Integrilin for 48
hours.  The patient was instructed to take Plavix for life
given that she is aspirin allergic.  Beta-blocker was
started. The patient did not have any bronchospasm.  It was
titrated to 25 mg of metaproterenol b.i.d. without any
pulmonary concerns.  Conduction, there were no concerns.  The
patient was monitored on Tele throughout her stay.  PUMP:
The patient had echo, EF of 70% with normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**], normal
wall motion.  ACE inhibitor was started, Lisinopril 10 mg q.
day.

PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient has asthma.  The patient had
minimal wheezing daily.  She was continued on beta-blocker,
continued on inhalers, her stable home regimen with normal O2
stats throughout her stay.

BACK:  The patient has chronic back pain.  This was stable
and managed with her current home regimen.

GI:  Of concern was whether or not patient will have
recurrent heartburn symptoms which seems to be her anginal
equivalent.  She was continued on Protonix and this pain did
not recur throughout her stay.

PHYSICAL THERAPY:  Saw the patient, she ambulated well and
was approved for discharge home without services.

NUTRITION:  Consulted the patient and instructed the patient
and gave the patient handouts regarding cardiac diet.  The
patient was given the dietician's name and phone number and
referred to outpatient nutrition therapy clinic for follow-up
and education.

RISK FACTOR MODIFICATIONS:  The patient was strongly
encouraged multiple times every day throughout her admission
to stop smoking.  She was given a nicotine patch.  She was
also told that she should have a sleep apnea evaluation as an
outpatient, given her large neck, history of snoring and the
high risks of CHS and sleep apnea.

The patient's primary care provider was called.  Her hospital
course was discussed.  That provider's name is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 29478**] at [**Hospital1 1474**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3183**].  It was
discussed that the patient needs smoking cessation
counseling.  Wellbutrin was considered to be started on in
the hospital, but was deferred to the primary care provider
who said that she would follow up.  The primary care provider
also said that she would set the patient up with a
cardiologist in [**Hospital1 1474**].

The patient was determined to be stable and ready for
discharge home without services, was instructed to continue
taking Plavix for life, pravastatin 40 q. day, Toprol XL 50
q. day, lisinopril 10 q. day, Univasc 30 mg b.i.d., Diovan 80
mg q. day, Pravachol 40 mg q. day, Tricor 50 mg q. day,
amitriptyline 10 mg q. day, Trazodone 50 mg q.h.s., Neurontin
300 mg t.i.d., Benadryl prn 50 mg q. day, Singulair 10 mg q.
day, Flovent 220 mcg three puffs t.i.d., Serevent 50 mg two
puffs t.i.d., Flexeril 10 mg t.i.d., urecholine 25 mg b.i.d.,
Nexium 40 mg q. day, Humibid 600 mg q. day.

The patient was given prescriptions for Plavix, pravastatin,
nicotine patches, Toprol XL as well as a prescription for a
couple of tablets of Bisacodyl for constipation.

The patient's primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 29478**], said that
she would call the patient and set up an appointment within
one week.  She would also set up an appointment with the
cardiologist for the patient within one week.  The patient
was instructed to never smoke again, to eat a low-fat,
low-cholesterol cardiac diet and to participate in a cardiac
rehabilitation program established by her cardiologist.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  ST elevation/MI.
2.  GERD.
3.  Depression.
4.  Obesity.
5.  Asthma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain:  The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  However, with her history of disease, patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization.  The patient was found
at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent
restenosis in the mid stent, otherwise hemodynamically normal
and the coronary arteries otherwise were without
flow-limiting stenoses.

The patient was then continued on her cardiac medications.
It was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her
while an inpatient, then she would benefit from the use of
aspirin and Plavix.  The patient was sent to the CCU and
underwent aspirin desensitization protocol, which she tolerated
well.  She had mild worsening of her asthma attacks, which was
relieved by Benadryl and occasionally albuterol.  The patient
found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her
Benadryl that she takes for sleep, that the asthma exacerbation
did not occur. Aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy
for this patient, and she is going to take this as an outpatient.

mg q.d.

3. Back pain:  This is a chronic issue and was controlled
with Flexeril and Vicodin.

CXR [**2194-7-28**]
There is mild postoperative widening of the superior
mediastinum. Heart size is normal. A pleural tube overlies
region of previous nodule in the left lower lung. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. ET tube, right jugular
introducer, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. The
tip of the endotracheal tube is probably less than 2 cm from
either the carina or the underside of the clavicles, with the
chin extended. Withdrawal of the tube by approximately 15 mm
would put it in optimal placement.

CXR [**2194-8-6**]
Nasogastric tube should be advanced at least 6 cm to move all
the side ports into the stomach. ET tube is in standard
placement. Moderate enlargement of the postoperative cardiac
silhouette is stable and unremarkable. There is no pleural
abnormality. Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**8-4**]. No
pleural abnormality.

ECHO [**2194-7-31**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
3. There is no pericardial effusion.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2194-7-10**],
there has been no significant change.

[**2194-7-28**] EKG

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] was electively admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-7-28**]
for surgical management of her coronary artery disease. She was
taken directly to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels. Postoperatively
she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. The pulmonology service
was consulted for hypoxia. An echo was obtained which ruled out
tamponade. Subcutaneous heparin was started for pulmonary
embolism prophylaxis. As no ventilatory problems were
identified, other findings were consistent with pulmonary edema
and diuresis was optimized. She continued to be hypoxic and
BIPAP was started. She was transfused with red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. On postoperative day three, Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**]
was reintubated for respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy was
performed which showed normal airways and a bronchoalveolar
lavage was sent for culture. Vancomycin and Zosyn were started
given her fevers and she was pan cultured. A blood cultured
revealed coagulase negative staph in one bottle and she
clinically improved on antibiotics. Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] slowly weaned
from the ventilator and was again extubated on postoperative day
ten. Diuresis was continued. On postoperative day eleven, Ms.
[**Known lastname 32857**] was transferred to the step down unit for further

Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   84 year old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin who was transferred from New
[**Location (un) 30389**] [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 188**] for management of subdural hematoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 14475**] on [**2175-2-1**], for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation treatment.  She
was found on the ground on [**2175-2-9**].  Initial CT scan was
noted for bleed but she subsequently developed decreased
mental status.  Repeat CT scan on [**2175-2-10**], revealed left
subdural hematoma with midline shift.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
where, on presentation, she was somewhat awake and was able
to squeeze the left hand on command, but was not able to move
the right side of her body at all.  She developed increasing
somnolence and was taken to the Operating Room for a
craniotomy and evacuation.

She was initially transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.  There, she continued to have very poor mental status.
She occasionally appeared able to follow commands, but was
not displaying purposeful movements of the upper or lower
extremities.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit on [**2175-2-22**], for management of recurrent fevers
to a temperature of 101.0 F, to 102.0 F., as well as for a
failure to wean off the ventilator.

She had a tracheostomy in place and while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit received trials where she was allowed to
breathe on her own off the ventilator.  She usually was only
able to breathe for several hours before she would fatigue
and would have to be put back on the ventilator.

She continued to spike temperatures to 101.0 F., to 102.0 F.
The source of these fevers were unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] sputum, blood
and urine were cultured multiple times and were always
negative.  A CT scan of the chest did not reveal any obvious
source of infection.

Her mental status continued to be poor; she was unable to
speak.  She did not appear able to make purposeful movements
and in general did not display any improvement in her
neurologic status.  Given her overall poor prognosis and her
very low probability for a meaningful recovery, the family
decided on [**2175-3-3**], that they wished to withdraw care for
her on the evening of [**2175-3-4**].

Addendum to Discharge Summary to follow.

pulmonary edema. Although most frequently due to congestive
heart failure, the differential diagnosis for pulmonary edema is
broad and includes central nervous system disorders, sensitivity
reaction, aspiration, and hemorrhage.

[**4-3**] KUB: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with NG tube
visualized with
the tip in the stomach.

[**4-4**] TTE: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. EF
60-65%. Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. The valves are well seen without significant
regurgitation making endocarditis unlikely.
.
[**4-8**] TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. A central line is seen in the SVC/right
atrium without evidence of overlying thrombus/vegetation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 42 cm
from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Trace aortic regurgitation with normal valve
morphology.

Brief Hospital Course:
30 F w/ IDDM c/b gastroparesis and HTN p/w n/v and coffee-ground
emesis concerning for UGIB.

In the MICU, patient was transfused 1U PRBC with hematocrit
remaining stable and stool guaiac negative. She was seen by GI
who felt that the NG return showed brown, not coffee-ground
emesis and deferred endoscopy given hemodynamic and hematocrit
stability. Her MICU course was otherwise notable for respiratory
distress attributed to possible aspiration in the setting of her
emesis. She required a non-rebreather to keep up her sats in the
morning, but was quickly weaned to 3L nasal canula. [**Month/Day/Year **]
cultures were significant for coag positive S. aureus. Patient
was started on vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage. A TTE
was done which was read with a low likelihood of endocarditis.
Stool cultures, urine cultures negative to date. Influenza swab
was negative. NGT was clamped and removed prior to call out to
the floor. Finally, patient presented with [**Last Name (un) **]- FeNa was 0.21%
consistent with a prerenal process. Renal was consulted.
.
Pt was transferred to the floor on [**4-5**]. On the floor, issues
were managed as follows:

# MSSA Bactermia: MSSA grew in [**3-18**] bottles on [**2-25**].
Surveillance cultures were negative. From prior hospitalization,
[**Month/Year (2) **] culture from [**3-28**] was negative. the bacteremia was thought
to be [**3-18**] PIV. No vegetations were seen on TTE. Vancomycin was
initially started. ID was consulted on HD #4 and recommended
TEE, which was performed on [**4-8**] and showed no vegetation. PICC
line was placed. Patient was discharged to complete 14-days of
cefazolin 2g q8h. Outpatient MRI order was entered for [**2150-4-17**]
with plans to obtain BUN/Cr prior to study.
.
# Hypoxia: Initial CXR showed pulmonary edema. Pt was on
non-rebreather in the ICU. She was treated for HAP initially
with Vancomycin/Zosyn. There was also concern for aspiration
pneumonia given aspiration history, however radiographs were not
consistent with this diagnosis. On HD #4, zosyn and vancomycin
were discontinued. Pt was weaned from oxygen and was ambulating
comfortably on room air prior to discharge.
.
# ? GI bleeding: Treated as above in the ICU. On the floor, the
patient had no further episodes of nausea/vomiting. Hct was
stable. Pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID was continued but stopped
prior to discharge. Aspirin was held initially, restarted upon
discharge.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Creatinine increased to 3.1
from baseline of ~ 1.4. Renal was consulted and felt the
clinical picture and urine sediment were most consistent with
ATN. Medications were renally dosed. Cr improved to 2.2 and BUN
to 34 from a peak of 45.
.
# HTN: On the floor, [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure was managed with verapamil
40 mg q8h, which was uptitrated to 120 mg q8h. Lisinopril was
held due to acute kidney injury. [**Month/Day/Year **] pressures were
consistently 160s-170s/80s-90s. Plans were for her to see her
PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] to restart lisinopril and uptitrate BP
medications as necessary. Patient was discharged on 360 mg ER
Verapamil.
.
# IDDM: A1C = 10%. Lantus eventually uptitrate to 20 U (home
dose). Gabapentin was renally dosed. Diabetic diet was ordered.
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH slightly elevated but normal free T4.
Continued Levoxyl 75 mcg qday.
.
# Depression/anxiety: Continued home risperdal, fluoxetine.
.
Transitional Issues:
- BP control: likely restart lisinopril as Cr normalizes;

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
MSSA Bacteremia
Acute on chronic kidney disease
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF
Hypertension
.
Secondary:
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you at the [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for nausea, vomiting, and
fever. There was concern that you had gastrointestinal bleeding
when you were vomiting, though this is not certain. [**Hospital1 **]
cultures showed that you had bacteria in your [**Hospital1 **] - called
staphylococcus aureus. For this infection, you will need to
complete 2 weeks of antibiotics and you will need an MRI to rule
out infection in your back (since you had persistent back pain).
You had an echo, which ruled out infection of your heart valves.
Also, we worked to bring your [**Hospital1 **] pressure under better
control though it was still high. Your kidneys showed acute
dysfunction, but the function began to improve after you were
transferred out of the intensive care unit.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
We HELD Lisinopril because of kidney dysfunction; you will
likely restart this medication after meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
We INCREASED Verapamil to better control your [**Last Name (STitle) **] pressure;
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may decrease the dose of this medicine as lisinopril is
restarted
We STARTED lidocaine patch for back pain
We STARTED Cefazolin to treat your bacteremia; you will complete
14-days of antibiotics; last day is [**2150-4-17**].
.
Your follow-up information is listed below. You will need an MRI
of your thoracic and lumbar spine to rule out osteomyelitis in
your spine within the next 2 weeks. You need to have [**Month/Day/Year **] tests
of your kidney function performed prior to this study.

Followup Instructions:
Department: [**Hospital3 249**]
When: FRIDAY [**2150-4-10**] at 10:20 AM

Chief Complaint:
Hypertension urgency, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Acute Diastolic CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
30 year old Female who presents to the ED with worst headache of
her life, found to be having malignant hypertension with a [**First Name3 (LF) **]
pressure approximately 210/110. She was also noted with severe
hyperglycemia 383, rose 445 on arrival to the floor. She is also
noted in diastolic CHF with a markedly elevated BNP. She was
hypoxemic as well at 88% on room air.
.
The patient notes she has felt terrible for over a week, with
vomitting on the day of arrival and may have skipped 1-2 doses
of her insulin sliding scale as a result. She denies fever or
chills. She reports that her hypertension has been very
difficult to manage, recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over at [**Last Name (un) **]
on [**7-8**], and her medications were adjusted. On morning of
admission her BP this AM was 211/110. She was driven to the ED
by her mother for her pounding frontal and left sided headache.
  Pt was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 36190**]/[**2150**] for viral meningitis but
reports resolution of her symptoms prior to this episode. She
notes a R hallux toenail fell off a few weeks ago but denies any
pain, redness or swelling. She she denies any other infectious
symptoms including fever, congestion, cough, SOB, dysuria, or
diarrhea.
  In the ED initial vital signs were 97.3 99 196/106 20 100%.
She was transiently triggered for hypoxia s/p receiving zofran
4mg, morphine 4mg, her sats was 88% on RA, which improved with
O2 to 98% on 2L. EKG showed nsr, no ST changes. Patient declined
LP, Ha resolved. Labs were notable Cr of 2.7 (baseline 1.3 in
[**3-/2150**]), proBNP: 8244, Hct: 28.3 (baseline), Trop-T: 0.07, Gluc
of 383, AGap=22. CT Head W/O Contrast negative for acute
intracranial process. CXR notable for fluid overload. Pt was
given zofran 8mg IV, reglan 10mg IV, Morphine Sulfate x1,
labetolol 20mg IV x2, hydral 10mg IV x 1, Lorazepam, Furosemide,
Aspirin 325mg, 10U SQ x1. Patient was admitted for HTN
urgency/emergency with hyperglycemia and transferred to the MICU
for insulin drip, HTN, and fluid management. Vital signs prior
to transfer 161/79 86 19 100%2L.
   In the ICU she was placed on insulin drip with normalization
of ion gap and was transitioned to her home glargine and ISS,
diabetic diet and D5 1/2NS+20K. She was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] this
morning who recommended q2-4h FSBG, home glargine 20U QAM and an
increased humalog sliding scale.
   Her [**Last Name (un) **] pressure was controlled on her home regimen with
goal BP in 140-150. Her lisinopril and furosemide were held in
the context of [**Last Name (un) **]. Her renal injury was treated with gentle
hydration and Cr remained stable. Her mild hypoxia in the ED
resolved in the MICU, patient was transferred to the floor on
room air. She was continued on all of her other home
medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
30F with poorly controlled TIDM c/b gastroparesis and
neuropathy, HTN, CKD, Diastolic CHF who presented to the ED
[**2150-8-3**] with headache and hypertensive urgency found to have
elevated FSBG to 300s, +AG, fluid overload, and [**Last Name (un) **] with unclear
precipitant, admitted to the MICU and stabilized on insulin drip
and antihypertensive, transferred to the floor on home [**Last Name (un) **]
and [**Last Name (un) **] pressure medications.
.
#. DKA/T1DM: Pt's CBGs ranged 400-500s for 1-2 days. Patient was
admitted with CBG of 383 and AG 17. She was admitted to the ICU
for initiation of insulin drip. Her AG normalized following
insulin drip and she was restarted on her home glargine and
sliding scale confirmed with [**Last Name (un) **] consultation. Etiology of
elevated [**Last Name (un) **] sugars remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] infectious w/u
negative. In addition, podiatry felt that her right toe lesion
was not infected. Possible etiologies include poor PO intake and
reduced insulin dosing [**3-18**] vomiting and headache caused by her
high BP. Admission HA1C 8.0. She was discharged with [**Month/Day (2) **]
sugars between 88-139 with keto dip sticks and an emergency
glucagon kit and [**Last Name (un) **] follow up.
.
#. Hypertensive Urgency: Etiology of acute increase in BP
despite medication unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] likely acute worsening of
chronically progressive diabetic macrovascular disease despite
recent medication increase. HA and N/V likely related to
elevated BP (consistent with prior episodes), CT negative for
acute intracranial process. Patient was restarted on home
verapamil and hydralazine but lisinopril was initially held [**3-18**]
elevated Cr. Her BP was in goal range (SBP 140-150) on transfer
from the ICU but increased to 180/100 on the morning of [**2150-8-5**].
Lisinopril was added back. Pt insisted on discharge despite
elevated [**Date Range **] pressures. The risks and benefits of leaving the
hospital including headache, nausea, worsening heart failure,
worsening kidney function and intracranial hemorrhage were
discussed with the patient; however, patient elected to leave on
her home verapamil, hydralazine and lisinopril with discharge
clinic f/u on Friday [**2150-8-7**].
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: Patient's presentation is
consistent with acute on chronic worsening of diastolic CHF (BNP
elevated >8000) with hypertension leading to increased
afterload, reduced filling and pulmonary and peripheral edema
that also likely contributed to patient's renal injury. Patient
was initially volume overloaded and received lasix in the ED and
ICU. On transfer to the floor patient appeared euvolemic with
clear lung exam and no peripheral edema so lasix was held in
light of her worsening renal function. This can be re-addressed
at [**Hospital 1944**] clinic appointment.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Pt's Cr was 1.0 in
[**1-/2150**] worsening to 1.8 in the past 6 months, elevated to 2.8
on admission. Unclear etiology. Renal ultrasound [**3-/2150**] showed
worsening parenchymal disease, UPEP was normal. Most likely
multifactorial namely acute pre-renal azotemia (admission BUN:Cr
~20:1) [**3-18**] hypertension, poor PO, and osmotic diuresis from DKA,
coupled with sub-acute worsening of intrinsic renal disease [**3-18**]
T1DM and HTN. Pt initially received gentle lasix diuresis to
euvolemia. Urine output remained adequate, u/a positive for
glucose, ketones and protein, negative for infection. Her
lisinopril was initially held but then restarted as her BP
elevated. Her outpatient nephrologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and will
follow up with her one week after discharge.
.
# Elevated troponin: Pt had troponin elevated to 0.07 on
admission  most likely secondary to demand ischemia from
increased afterload in hypertensive urgency and worsened by
decreased renal clearance. Pt was asx with negative EKGs;
however, troponins were trended given her high risk as a
diabetic and possibility of atypical chest pain with neuropathy.
Repeat troponins stablized, CK-MB were trended and negative.
.
#. Hypoxia: Mild hypoxemia in the ED in the context of patient
anxiety as well as hypertension, increasing afterload on chronic
diastolic HF (BNP >8000) leading to pulmonary vascular
congestion (confirmed on CXR). Oxygenation improved on arrival
in the MICU, where she received mild lasix diuresis, and
resolved on arrival to the floor.
.
# Rt Toe Lesion: Toe showed no signs of drainage or pus, no
erythema noted. FXR was negative for osteo. Podiatry consulted
and recommended dry sterile dressing with clinic follow up if
patient developed symptoms.
.
# Cataracts: Continued on Prednisone, vigamox and ciprofloxacin
eye gtt
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on home synthroid dose.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Mood stable. Continued on Fluoxetine and
risperdone.
.
# Neuropathy: continued home gabapentin
.
# Gastroparesis: Diabetic diet with home reglan PRN.
.
# Code: FULL CODE
.
# Transitional Issues:
- patient to follow-up in post discharge clinic for BP and
glycemic control monitoring
- will need electrolytes checked at post discharge clinic as
well
- volume status and renal function will need assessment at post
discharge clinic as well, as her lasix was held on discharge,
may need to be restarted
- patient provided with number for podiatry for right toe lesion
if any signs of worsening

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You came in with high [**Hospital1 **] sugars, and high
[**Hospital1 **] pressure, which caused nausea, vomiting and some damage to
your kidneys. We admitted you to the intensive care unit so that
we could give you continuous insulin and carefully monitor your
[**Hospital1 **] sugars. We also gave you medications to decrease your
[**Hospital1 **] pressure and fluids to help your kidneys. Your sugars
improved on the insulin and, with the help of your doctors [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**Name5 (PTitle) 4372**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **], we transitioned you to your home [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
medicines.
   Your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressue slightly improved, but remained elevated
on discharge. We discussed that we would prefer to keep you in
the hospital given your elevated [**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressure, but you decided
against this. We discussed the risks of leaving the hospital
with an elevated [**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressure with you and you felt that you
still would like to leave.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54 year-old female
with a long history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
alcohol use who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital after she
was admitted for an acute psychotic episode after self
discontinuing her psychiatric medications around the 12th of
Hospital before being transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on
the [**9-19**].  On the [**9-19**] she
presented to the Emergency Room where she was found to be
noncommunicative on admission.  In addition, she had a
temperature of 102.8, pulse of 120 and a systolic blood
pressure of 130 to 140 with a respiratory rate of 30.  In
addition, the patient was noted to have gross tremors at

In the Emergency Room the patient was given Levofloxacin for
presumed community acquired pneumonia.  Psychiatry Service
was consulted to work her up for neuroleptic malignant
syndrome, because of her high fever and also because her CK
was found to be 928 on admission with no MB and no
significant electrocardiogram changes.  In the Emergency Room
she was given Ativan and then transferred to the MICU for
stabilization.

In the MICU she was noted to have a high sodium (160) and she
was started on D5 half normal saline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
observation of her cardiac enzymes and also to complete her
infectious disease workup and to help her defervesce.  The
patient as previously stated was started on Levofloxacin
although her chest x-ray on the day of admission was negative
for any infiltrate.  The patient's urinalysis done on
hospital day number one showed 100 protein, trace glucose, 3
red blood cells, 3 white blood cells, no bacteria and 4 epis.
The urine culture was negative for infection.  Multiple
attempts were made to do an LP at the bedside, however, the
LP ultimately had to be done under fluoroscopy.  The LP done
on hospital day number two was negative for evidence of
meningitis or any other infection.  The patient defervesced
on hospital day number two and was transferred to the regular
medicine floor.  Her sodium at that time was still elevated
at 156.  The patient on the floor was continued on aggressive
hydration with D5 half normal saline at 175 cc an hour.  In
addition with serial chemistry laboratories drawn.  In
addition the patient's CK was followed throughout the course
of the admission.  Throughout the hospitalization the patient
was maintained off of psychotropic medications and was given
only hydration as per the recommendation by psychiatry.

On physical examination the patient continued to have
stiffness in all extremities and a gross resting tremor.
However, by hospital day number three she was able to follow
simple commands.  Over the course of the hospitalization the
patient's CK continued to drop and gradually cam eto normal
levels. In
addition, the patient's sodium level continued to normalize
over the course of the hospitalization and her sodium on the
day of discharge to psychiatry is 141.  The patient's H&H
remained stable over the course of the hospitalization.  On
hospital day number three her hematocrit was 41.8.  The
belief was that the patient on admission was extremely dry. On
hospital day number
three, because of the patient's increased agitated state a
one to one sitter was needed and put in to place.  The
patient has since then been relatively cooperative and
spending most of her days lying in bed.  The patient and had
evidence of significant delirium with lethargy, slurred speech
and disorientation that lasted for subsequent week. She had
periods of agitation requiring ativan. over time we were able to
taper down the ativan and her mental status steadily improved. At
the time of transfer to psychiatry on [**2169-10-3**] pt was taking
adequate Pos, using the bathroom. She knew she was in the
hospital and what her name was but did not know other details
of current events. She had evidence of tardive dyskinesia with
contiued oral buccal movements and constant picking/hand and
finger movements. The patient will be discharged to an inpatient
psychiatric
floor here at the [**Hospital1 **].
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] issue: enterococcal UTI- treated with d/c of foley and
amoxicillin. diarrhea- marked during initial part of hospital
stay. her family reports that she chronically has diarrhea.
Abdominal exam benign. labs remarkable for mild LFT
abnormalities. hepatitis serologies neg. stool sent for culture

Date of Birth:   [**2115-9-18**]       Sex:  F


ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum.  The patient was not
discharged on [**2169-9-23**], due to the fact that
Psychiatry felt that she was not ready to go and felt that
she had not undergone a subsequent thorough delirium workup.

1.  NEUROLOGY:  The patient had a normal TSH.  The patient
was found to have negative CT scan for any evidence of bleed
or pathology.  The patient was RPR nonreactive.  The patient
had a normal folate level and vitamin B12 level and was found
to be cleared in terms of her metabolic causes of delirium.
The patient was maintained on Ativan, and due to increase

The patient's creatine kinases continued to be monitored due
to the fact that she had neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and
on the day of discharge her creatine kinase was at 232.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was found to have had
increased motility of stool with numerous diarrhea episodes
from the dates of [**9-23**] to [**9-27**].  She
underwent a stool culture which was found to be negative, and
Clostridium difficile culture which was found to be negative.
The patient was subsequently placed on Imodium with
subsequent resolution of frequent bowel movements.  The
patient had undergone some skin breakdown due to the frequent
bowel movements and Nystatin cream and ....................
ointment were applied to the buttocks with improvement of
area erythema and irritation.

3.  GENITOURINARY:  The patient had Foley catheter due to the
fact that she was unable to inform personnel when she had to
void.  Her urine was cultured and was found to be positive
with enterococcus greater than 100,000.  She was subsequently
placed on amoxicillin 250 mg p.o. t.i.d.

4.  RENAL:  The patient had elevated AST and ALT of 52
and 83, respectively.  This was most likely thought secondary
to muscle breakdown.  However, a hepatitis panel was run and
was found to be negative for hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
However, hepatitis A results were still pending upon
discharge; although, the patient was afebrile without any
abdominal pain or tenderness.

5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was on
intravenous fluid hydration just due to decreased p.o.
intake.  However, her electrolytes remained normal.  Her
sodium was 145 upon discharge, and her potassium was 3.8.
However, the patient did have increased p.o. intake upon
discharge with encouragement.  A Nutrition consultation was
sought during this stay, and the patient was advised to be on
Boost shakes.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was subsequently discharged
to a Medical Psychiatric Unit in order for the initiation of
psychiatric medications.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 7 cm suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm
with chronic renal insufficiency.  The patient was initially
hospitalized on [**2125-9-24**] to [**2125-9-28**] for
evaluation of his abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He was
angiography which demonstrated the patient was not a
candidate for intraluminal stent grafting and an open repair
aneurysm would be required.  The computerized tomography
angiography demonstrated a markedly tortuous suprarenal
aortic aneurysm with tortuous right iliac artery.  There was
occlusion of the celiac artery with a widely patent superior
mesenteric and right renal artery.  The left renal artery was
common iliac was aneurysmal and this extended well into the
external iliac on the right side.  The patient tolerated the
computerized tomographic angiography.  His creatinine
remained stable at 1.7.  During his hospitalization he was
evaluated by the Cardiac Service and he underwent a
Persantine thallium which was normal and revealed no
electrocardiogram changes or perfusion deficits.  Ejection
fraction was calculated at 57%.  The patient was discharged
to home in stable condition where he would arrange follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and elective surgical date.  The patient
returns now for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He
denies any interval changes, both system or symptom-wise.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Terazosin 10 mg q.d.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4.  Lopressor 100 mg daily

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Previous medical illnesses include a
left colectomy with colostomy and reversal secondary to
diverticulitis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension
and chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of
1.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient arrived and was admitted the
night prior to surgery.  He was hydrated and on [**2125-10-2**] underwent repair of a supraceliac abdominal aortic
aneurysm with an aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-iliac bypass graft and a left
aortorenal artery bypass using 6 mm Dacron.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and he was given Kefzol
perioperatively.  He was transferred to the Surgery Intensive
Care Unit for continued monitoring and care.  The patient's
intensive Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by
 adult respiratory distress syndrome,
respiratory failure, sepsis and periencephalopathy.  Blood
cultures grew enterococci and gram negative rods.  Sputum
cultures were similar.  The patient required hemodialysis
secondary to acute renal failure.  He was nutritionally
supported with total parenteral nutrition.  He had a right
femoral venous dialysis catheter placed for his hemodialysis.
The antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and
Flagyl.  Zosyn was added on [**2125-10-16**].  The patient
was treated for a total of a 28 day course of Ciprofloxacin
for his Enterobacter and Vancomycin for the enterococcus and
coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  The patient was weaned to
a T-piece on [**2125-10-18**].  The patient eventually was
weaned on [**2125-10-20**] without incident.  He remained NPO
and continued on total parenteral nutrition for nutritional
support.  The patient continued to show mental status
improvement in his respiratory status and renal function.
Dialysis was discontinued on [**2125-10-21**] and the right
femoral catheter was removed at that time.  His triple lumen
catheter was also changed at this time to a new site.  He has
continued to be NPO and on total parenteral nutrition.  The
nasogastric tube was placed for consideration for tube
feeding.  He was transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care
Unit for continued monitoring and care on [**2125-10-22**]
which was postoperative day #19.  The patient continued to
have episodes of hypertension requiring readjustment of his
antihypertensive medications.

Otorhinolaryngology was requested to see the patient and
evaluate the patient's dysphagia on [**2125-10-24**].  He was
with a delayed swallow trigger and he was with significant
cough with problems of both consistencies of thin liquids and
solids.  The patient had clinical aspiration secondary to
deconditioning and prolonged intubation.  Recommendations
were to continue NPO and continue the nasogastric tube feeds
for nutrition and medication and wean total parenteral
nutrition.  Oral feeds were continued to be held.  The total
parenteral nutrition was weaned and discontinued on [**2125-10-26**].

Cardiology was requested to see the patient because of rhythm
problems for bradycardia with 4 second pauses.  They
evaluated rhythm to be in a junctional rhythm with a rate of
40 to 50 associated with hypertension with episodes of sinus
rhythm.  They felt this was related to overmedication and
hypotension, cerebral under perfusion.  Medications were held
and Dopamine was begun to increase his heartrate to maintain
a systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160.  His
electrolytes were checked and repleted as indicated.  Head
computerized tomography scan was recommended and serial
cardiac enzymes, CKs and troponin levels were obtained.  His
serial CKs and troponin levels remained flat.  Magnetic
resonance was negative for cerebral infarct.

Neurology was requested to see the patient in the next 24
hours for new onset of right arm weakness.  Although an acute
infarct could not be noted in the watershed area they felt
that maybe he had had a lacunar infarct which would not be
visualized by magnetic resonance imaging scan.  It was felt
the right arm weakness was not secondary to a central lesion
but more possibly brachioplexus injury due to his prolonged
hospitalization.  Electrocardiogram over the next 24 hours
continued to show T wave depressions with increased QT
interval which was consistent with a central nervous system
event.  Recommendations were to begin to wean Dopamine,
discontinue intravenous fluids and hold antihypertensives.
The Metoprolol was restarted for maximum dose of 50 mg b.i.d.
and Norvasc could also be used for blood pressure control,
the goal or systolic blood pressure was 140 to 160 and
recommendations were not to add any additional agents unless
the systolic blood pressure was greater than 200.  The
patient was also evaluated by [**Hospital1 **] because of difficulty
with glucose management while the patient was on tube feeds
and total parenteral nutrition.  Their recommendations were
q.i.d. sugars, maintain his tube feeds at 65 cc/hr, continue
a sliding scale of Humalog q.i.d. and Atlantis 10 units at
h.s.  The patient was noted to have yeast in his urine
culture on [**2125-10-29**] and was given a three day course
of Fluconazole.

Otorhinolaryngology again evaluated the patient on [**2125-11-1**] regarding swallowing.  They felt the patient had
made overall improvement in his swallowing function and they
recommended continuing nasogastric tube feedings and defer
making any decisions on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
placement as the patient was making improvement in his
swallowing function.  On [**2125-10-31**], the resident was
called to the bedside at 4:40 AM with the patient in
respiratory distress.  He arrived to find the patient
breathing irregularly with a respiratory rate between 20 and
86.  Arterial blood gases were obtained at some point with
pCO2 was 81 peak, pO2 was 65, Carbon dioxide was 35.  Chest
x-ray was taken and was unchanged.  Electrocardiogram was
obtained which was unchanged.  The patient required
aggressive suctioning with improvement in the blood gas of
7.31, pCO2 59, pO2 138, and Carbon dioxide of 31.
Nasogastric tubes were discontinued and intravenous fluid was
begun.  The patient was transferred to the Surgery Intensive
Care Unit for continued monitoring and care.  It was also
noted the patient had an elevated white count at this time
and a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was
obtained.  His abdominal examination was soft and flat with
+/- mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant.  There was
no guarding or palpable masses, no left upper quadrant
tenderness.  The rectal examination was guaiac negative.
Computerized tomography scan showed an 8 by 13 collection
near the splenic hilum and tail of the pancreas with apparent
connection to region of the abdominal aortic aneurysm with
bilateral pleural effusions.  The right upper quadrant was
normal and the gallbladder and pancreas were normal.
Recommendations were computerized tomography scan-guided
drainage of the aspiration area and to send off
triglycerides, amylase and cultures from the drainage.  The
fluid that was aspirated was no growth and appeared to be an old
hematoma . Amylase obtained on
[**11-1**], and [**11-3**] were 139 and 113 respectively.
The patient's liver function tests, amylase and lipase were
all within normal range.  The patient required reintubation
on [**2125-11-1**].  Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe
infiltrate.  Blood gas after intubation were 7.1, 1, 103, 98,
35 and 0, pre-intubation 7.25, 68, 137, 31 and 0.  The
patient was extubated a second time on [**2125-11-2**].
Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin were restarted on [**2125-11-2**].  The patient had previously received a four week course
of both antibiotics.  Post line placement chest x-ray was
unremarkable.  Tube feeds were restarted on [**2125-11-3**].  Repeat echocardiogram was obtained on [**11-5**]
which showed a diminishing ejection fraction from 55% to 30%.
Cardiology was requested to review these findings.  There
were no focal wall abnormalities, new ones noted, to suggest
acute myocardial injury.  Recommendations were to treat the
patient conservatively and to continue on his
antihypertensive to maintain a systolic blood pressure
between 131 and 140.

Otorhinolaryngology did see the patient again on [**11-5**].
There was improvement in his swallowing but they felt that he
still might be aspirating.  He underwent a swallow study
which showed pooling in navicular.  After consultation with
primary care service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] it was decided that the tube
would be removed and the patient would be allowed to begin
p.o.s and calorie counts would be monitored.  The patient did
not aspirate on the swallow study but was at an increased
risk for aspiration.  Recommendations were soft solids and
thick liquids and aspiration precautions.

Physical therapy followed the patient during his
postoperative period and recommendations were that he would
need acute rehabilitation once medically stable.  Calorie
counts were begun on [**11-8**] until [**11-10**], which
were pending at the time of dictation.  The patient will be
discharged to rehabilitation when medically stable and a bed
is available.  Wounds were clean, dry and intact.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-10-20**] 10:12 PM
IMPRESSION: Several large ring-enhancing lesions in the
cerebellum. In the setting of advanced metastatic colon cancer,
as this patient is known to have, these probably represent colon
cancer metastases. No definite hemorrhage, although there is
moderately dense material surrounding the lesions on the
pre-contrast imaging. Non-communicating hydrocephalus is
present, associated with either occlusion or high-grade
obstruction of the ventricular system. Findings discussed with
the covering team shortly after the study and put to the ER
dashboard as well.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is considerable
mass effect within the posterior fossa with inferior herniation
of the cerebellar tonsils.
.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2115-6-14**]:
Lung volumes are lower and multiple pulmonary nodules most
likely metastases are new. There is also generalized
interstitial abnormality which may represent lymphatic tumor
invasion. Small left pleural effusion is present. Heart is
normal size. Tip of the right subclavian infusion port projects
over the SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2118-10-22**] 4:39 PM
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C
IMPRESSION:
1. Substantial progression of disease with interval increase in
size and number of pulmonary lesions and more extensive
metastatic involvement of the liver. Increased mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
2. New, small left pleural effusion.
.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-10-22**] 2:12 AM
IMPRESSION: Rim-enhancing lesion in both cerebellar hemispheres
consistent with metastatic disease. Moderate obstructive
hydrocephalus. Edema involving the cerebellar hemispheres with
slightly low position of the cerebellar tonsils.

Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, arm tingling, weakness, and LLE weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Head CT

History of Present Illness:
58 yo man with h/o DMII, HTN, and metastatic rectal cancer with
metastases to the lung, liver, and cerebellum presents with
worsened unsteadiness and 2 episodes of left sided tingling, and
possible dysarthria.

He initially had his cerebellar mets diagnosed due to headache
on a CT in [**2118-10-20**] and had a VP shunt placed by neurosurgery. He
was started on decadron as well to taper at home. He had
continued unsteadiness, but walked around with a cane okay. He
reports that for the last 2 weeks, he has had worsened
unsteadiness and has been very tired, sleeping a lot. He says he
thinks this is
due to his XRT treatments which finished 6 days prior to
admission. He has not fallen.

Then, the day of presentation, he was at home and had the
gradual onset of tingling in his RUE with no [**Month (only) **] that lasted
1.5 hours. This came on slowly over 20-25 minutes. When it was
present he also felt his arm was very weak and he could not lift
it. He also had pain in that arm and felt as if a snake was
wrapped around his arm and squeezing it. It was not moving
clonically. It is unclear if it was tonic at times.  At about
the same time, his LLE was also weak, but this apparently
started after his arm weakness and only lasted ~25 minutes
before resolving. With all of this, he describes significant
dysarthria. He is unclear about the timing of all of this. He
then normalized, but came to the ED. While here, he had another
episode where his arm felt squeezed and weak again for ~25
minutes. His LLE was not as affected this time. This resolved
and he is currently at baseline.

On admission, he has a mild global headache and feels unsteady
as he has for the last 2 weeks. He has no other issues at this
time.

ROS: Patient denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
dysphagia, neck pain, visual changes, hearing changes, chest
pain, shortness of breath, or vertigo.

Imaging:
CXR ([**11-22**]): Unchanged appearance of advanced metastatic
disease, without discrete foci of consolidation. No radiographic
evidence of congestive heart failure.

HCT ([**11-22**]): A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is seen entering the
right frontal region and terminating in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Again seen is the large left cerebellar mass measuring 22 mm,
similar in appearance to the previous study. It has a smaller
amount of adjacent vasogenic edema. Also seen is the right
cerebellar mass, similar in size, with new high density foci
suggesting interval hemorrhage. Additionally, there is interval
prominence of the extra- axial space outlining the right lateral
frontal cerebral convexity, measuring 5 mm in thickness and
exerting mild mass effect, though there is no shift of the
normally midline structures. The volume of the lateral
ventricles has decreased since the last examination. No evidence
of acute major vascular territorial infarct is identified.
Ethmoid air cells and other sinuses are clear. No fractures are
seen. Burr hole for the right VP shunt noted.
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval appearance of high-density material
within the right cerebellar known metastasis representing
hemorrhage. Similar appearance of left cerebellar metastasis to
last exam. 2. New 5-mm crescentic subdural fluid collection
along the right frontal lateral cerebral convexity, exerting
very mild mass effect.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The right transfrontal VP shunt
is unchanged in position, terminating in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral ventricle, region of foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. However,
there has been a marked change in the appearance of the lateral
ventricular bodies since the [**2118-10-26**] study, which now appear
more slit-like. In additon, there is a moderate-sized subdural
collection layering over the right cerebral convexity, new,
which may be seen with ""intracranial hypotension."" These
findings, in the clinical context, are suggestive of
""over-shunting"".

MRI ([**11-23**]): A right frontal approach ventriculostomy drainage
catheter remains unchanged in position. Three cerebellar
enhancing metastatic lesions are identified, two in the left
cerebellar hemisphere and one in the right. These were present
on the prior examination. The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion
measures 2.7 x 2.4 cm and is largely unchanged. The larger of
the two left cerebellar hemisphere lesions measures 2.6 x 2.7 cm
and is slightly increased in size compared to the prior
examination where it measured approximately 2.6 x 2.2 cm. The
right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has an area of
susceptibility artifact which corresponds to increased
attenuation seen on the recent CT scan. Increased attenuation in
the left cerebellar hemispheric lesion demonstrates decreased
signal intensity on T2-weighted images. No susceptibility
artifact is noted in this left cerebellar hemispheric lesion.
There is a small amount of subdural fluid seen extending over
the entire right cerebral convexity. Post-contrast images
demonstrate dural enhancement over the right cerebral convexity.
The ventricles as seen on the prior recent CT scan are much
smaller in size compared to the CT from [**2118-9-30**]. There is
no change in the position of cerebellar tonsils on the sagittal
image. The suprasellar cistern is normal in appearance.
IMPRESSION: 1. Increased right subdural fluid and enhancement of
the dura with decrease in size of the ventricles suggest
intracranial hypotension. This may be due to over shunting from
the ventricular drainage catheter. 2. Multiple cerebellar
metastatic lesions. The right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has
an area of susceptibility artifact and corresponding to
increased attenuation on the CT suggestive of intratumoral
hemorrhage. The left hemispheric lesion has decreased T2 signal
intensity corresponding to increased attenuation on the CT and
likely represents calcification in a mucinous metastasis.

MRI c-spine: wet read: No evidence of metastatic bone disease to
the C-spine. No cervical cord compression or major cervical
canal stenosis. Mild multilevel degenerative disk changes.

EEG: official read pending, wet read no abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
58yo man with metastatic rectal ca and known cerebellar
metastases and hemorrhage into mets, presents with two discrete
episodes of left arm ""tingling"" or ""twisting"" into extension, no
LOC, lasting 30mins, followed immediately by left leg weakness.
This is most consistent with seizure, possibly from the
right-sided subdural fluid collection seen on MRI. Other
etiologies include hyperglycemia, direct effect from the bleed
in the cerebellum, though this should not cause arm extension,
TIA, though this is less likely, or compression of
brainstem/c-spine, in which he would be expected to have more
cranial nerve findings. He was initially admitted to the ICU for
closer neurologic monitoring given the abnormalities of his
posterior fossa. He was started on keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] and
continued on decadron, with a slightly higher dose of 4mg q8h
(after a 10mg bolus given in the ED). An MRI brain showed three
cerebellar metastases with new hemorrhage into one of these
metastases, as well as a new right-sided subdural fluid
collection and small ventricles. MRI of the cervical spine was
also performed, which showed no evidence of brainstem
compression or cervical canal stenosis. The radiologists raised
the question of overshunting, but this was discussed with the
neurosurgical team and determined to be of no concern and
requiring no change in management.

In addition, he was severely hyperglycemic on arrival in the ED.
He was treated with IVF and an insulin gtt, then started on NPH
with resulting improvement of BS control. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted
for better glycemic control, and he was started on glargine and
sliding scale insulin per their recommendations. He was
discharged to [**Last Name (un) **] for an appointment with diabetic teaching.

His hypertension was treated with metoprolol as with his home
regimen.

to have pancreatitis, increased mets in liver and lung, sepsis.
Patient was initially diagnosed with rectal CA in [**2115**], has had
resection of the primary and numerous attempts at chemo and
radiation for metastatic disease (see below). Most recent chemo
cycle finished in [**6-4**]. Disease has progressed despite these
treatments.
.
Patients reports that he was in his USOH until 3-4d ago, when he
developed diffuse abdominal pains, as well as pains in his lower
chest bilaterally.  These pains were constant and came on at
rest, and have become progressively more severe over the last 24
hours.  He also notes the onset of dyspnea to the point of not
being able to walk over the past 3d, with no cough or wheezing.
He reports no palpitations, no change in his LE edema.  Reports
recent diarrhea and loss of appetite, with no vomiting, no BRBPR
or melena.  Urine has become more dark.
.
Today, he kept his first appointment at the [**Hospital **] Clinic to be
evaluated for his diabetes, and he was found to be in
respiratory distress and unable to stand because of dyspnea and
chest pain.  He was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for evaluation.  On
presentation to the ED, his VS were: T 102.1, HR 140, BP 160/90,
RR 33-36, Sat 93% on ??. He complained of [**7-9**] pain in his
belly, desaturating with exertion.  VBG 7.49/38/30 on
suplemental oxygen, with lactate 4.7, LFTs, amylase, lipase
elevated, resulting in concern for pancreatitis.

.
[**2118-12-21**] CT CHEST/ABD
1. Interval progression of metastatic disease in the lungs and
liver.
There is progression of innumerable lung metastases with notable
conglomerate masses in the right lower lobe, measuring 3.6 x 2.3
cm, previously 2.5 x 1.7 cm.
2.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3.  Interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion.
4.  Interval development of gallbladder wall edema.  This could
suggest cholecystitis. There is apparent gallbladder wall
edema.  There is peripancreatic stranding and stranding and
small fluid tracking in the left and right anterior pararenal
spaces.
5.  Peripancreatic stranding with stranding and small fluid
tracking along the right and left anterior pararenal spaces
consistent with pancreatitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
A/P: 58yo man with h/o met rectal CA to liver, lungs, brain, now
p/w 3d of fatigue, SOB, abd pain, CP, diarrhea, found to have
pancreatitis, increased mets in liver and lung, sepsis.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for concern for
sepsis.  He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics
(Vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl) for concern for
pancreatitis/ascending cholangitis.  The Flagyl was subsequently
discontinued.  Blood, urine, sputum and stool cultures were sent
and are currently no growth to date.  His hypoxia was thought to
be secondary to his multiple pulmonary metastases as well as
worsening left pleural effusion.  He was started on a Morphine
PCA for both his severe abdominal pain as well as symptom
management of his severe dyspnea.  His elevated LFTs were
thought to be [**3-3**] to his liver metastases.  General surgery was
consulted but felt there was no further need for surgical
intervention and the patient would not likely benefit from a
percutaneous biliary drain.  Pain and palliative care was
consulted for assistance with pain control, and symptom
management as well as possible discussion of hospice/palliation.
 The patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was notified.
Vanco/Zosyn were d/c'd after further discussion with pt and his
family resulted in change of goals of care to CMO.  Pt was
started on morphine gtt for comfort on [**12-25**], as he continued to
have considerable pain with morphine PCA. He expired on [**12-27**] at
2:50 AM, surrounded by family members.

hematocrit 36.2, platelet count 177, sodium 144, potassium
4.3, chloride 99, PO2 32, BUN 36, creatinine 2.8, glucose 89,
EKG was within normal limits. Chest x-ray showed no bone
destruction, bilateral effusions, right greater than the
left, and enlarged cardiac silhouette.  The patient was taken
to the OR on [**2153-9-5**], for living unrelated renal
transplant. Surgeons were Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9768**], and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 39567**].

The patient received general anesthesia. Estimated blood loss
was 400 cc. The patient did well intraoperatively. Please
seen operative note. The patient intraoperatively required
take down of the renal artery anastomosis secondary to poor
arterial inflow.  He required iliac arteriotomy and
embolectomy. Post procedure he was managed in the post
anesthesia care unit doing well. Urine output was marginal
over several hours. Vital signs were stable. Duplex of the
kidney revealed good arterial wave forms with resistive
indices of 0.57 to 0.61. There was no perinephric fluid
collection.

The patient was given intraoperative immunosuppression with
500 of Solu-Medrol, 1 gram of CellCept, ATG 100 mg Ancef,
Valcyte and heparin assay preoperatively. Postoperative urine
output was 10 to 20 cc an hour with half normal saline cc per
cc replacement with a background IV of D5.5 of normal saline
at 50 cc an hour. The patient was treated with morphine PCA
for pain and was managed on insulin subcutaneous injections
for glucose control.

Postoperative hematocrit was 32.3, white blood cell count
4.6, K of 4.3, and creatinine of 3.3.  The patient was
transferred when stable to the medical surgical unit. Urine
output remained on the low side. Nephrology was consulted and
followed closely throughout the hospital course. IV fluid was
decreased. Breath sounds were decreased half way up on
bilaterally. Oxygen saturations were 98% on 2 liters, blood
pressure 100/58. Low dose Lopressor was started on
postoperative day 1.

Chest x-ray was repeated after placement of an NG tube for
abdominal distention, nausea. Repeat duplex revealed poorly
visualized venous outflow. The patient returned to the
operating room for reexploration of the kidney under general
anesthesia by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with assistant Dr. [**Known firstname **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9768**], resident on [**2153-9-6**]. Please see operative note.
Minimal estimated blood loss. Urine output q 1 hour 10 to 40
cc an hour. The patient was given IV dopamine and maintained
on an IV of normal saline at 10 cc an hour.

Repeat chest x-ray to assess endotracheal tube was done. ET
tube was pulled back 5 cm. The patient was treated with
morphine for pain, restarted on heparin 5000 units t.i.d. The
kidney was noted to be pink with good arterial and venous
flow. The patient was started on clear liquids on
postoperative day 1. He did complain of some nausea. [**Last Name (un) **]
was consulted for management of hyperglycemia. Blood sugars
ran in the 300s. IV insulin drip was started and then later
discontinued with adjustment of subcutaneous insulin.

The patient underwent a TEE on [**2153-9-6**] with notation
of severely depressed right ventricular systolic function
with moderate dilatation. Systolic function was noted to be
severely depressed globally. The apex was noted to be
akinetic with moderate to severe .....  Comments were noted
that mitral valve flow was normal. The patient was
transferred to the surgical intensive care unit postoperative
reexploration of the kidney transplant.

Postoperative hematocrit was 27.7 with a white blood cell
count of 6.6, creatinine was noted to be 3.7 and BUN of 58,
potassium 4.1. The patient ws intubated and sedated. He was
on propofol for sedation and dopamine to increase cardiac
output with goal to keep greater than cardiac index of 2 with
blood pressure greater than 120. The patient was started on a
Lasix strip. The patient was extubated on postoperative day
2, 1.

The patient was transferred from the post anesthesia care
unit to the medical surgical unit on [**2153-9-7**], with
renal attending reviewed this case. The patient produced 1270
cc of urine over the prior 17 hours on Lasix drip. Prograf
was deferred. The patient continued on ATG. He received a
total of 4, 100 mg once daily doses on postoperative day 4
and postoperative day 5. He received half dose for white
blood cell count of 2.3 and 2.1 respectively. NG tube
continued to drain minimal greenish drainage. The abdomen was
soft and nontender, nondistended with no bowel sounds heard.
Lasix was weaned off on postoperative day 4. Urine output for
the previous 24 hours had been 1102 with a creatinine of 3.5.
Vital signs remained stable. Repeat chest x-ray revealed
worsening CHF with notation of right large pleural effusion
with moderate left effusion with left lower lobe
consolidation.

Prograf was started on postoperative day 4 at 2 mg b.i.d,
Solu-Medrol was tapered down to 25 mg PO twice a day and then
stopped on postoperative day 7. He continued in CellCept 1
gram b.i.d until postoperative day 8 when this was decreased
to 500 mg QID. Prograf level returned on postoperative day 7
with a left of 20. Prograf was adjusted to 3 mg b.i.d. IV
Lasix was continued orally at 80 mg b.i.d Foley was removed.
The patient was unable to urinate. Foley was replaced. The
patient was given a second attempt at Foley beig removed and
again unable to void. Foley was replaced and the patient was
started on Flomax 0.4 mg PO qhs.

Of note the patient underwent biopsy of the transplant kidney
on [**9-6**], postoperative 1, during reexploration of the
transplanted kidney. Biopsy results demonstrated no
rejection. One unit of packed red blood cells was
administered on [**9-11**] for a hematocrit of 27.6. Post
transfusion hematocrit was 32.7. Urine output was 1 liter.
Improved graft function was noted with a creatinine of 3.5
and BUN of 88. The patient was advanced to renal diet.
Physical therapy was consulted. It was felt that the patient
would require 2 to 3 treatments to improve endurance, balance
and gait and see if safe for stair climbing. Right lower
quadrant incision remained intact with clips with scant
serosanguineous drainage. [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output initially was
300 cc. This diminished postoperatively. [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] was
discontinued on postoperative day 7 and 6. Epogen was started
at 10,000 units 3 times a week. The patient was not iron
deficient. Protonix was started b.i.d for persistent nausea.
PhosLo was stopped. The patient was started on Colace for
complaints of inability to move bowels. The patient was
passing flatus. CellCept was decreased to 500 QID for
complaints of frequent stools. Colace was held.

Creatinine was noted to increase on postoperative day [**12-13**].
Creatinine increased to 4.5 with a BUN of 111. Previous day
urine output had been 755 cc with a combined PO and IV intake
of 300 cc. The patient had complained of nausea. IV fluid was
given. Urine output increased slightly for the subsequent 24
hours at a liter. Repeat creatinine was 4.2. The patient
remained afebrile. Blood pressure 110 to 120/68 to 81. Oxygen
saturations on room air 96%. Urine output averaged
approximately 20 cc an hour despite an extra dose of Lasix.
The patient received inpatient nutritional assessment for
decreased intake. Napro was recommended. Calorie counts were
started. Hemodialysis was deferred.

Cardiology was consulted on [**9-14**]. Cardiology was asked
to see the patient for persistent congestive heart failure
that was noted on x-ray and weight remained increased at 98
kg. Recommendations were to decrease IV fluids, to continue
with IV Lasix 80 mg and to restart aspirin and Plavix if
surgically acceptable. In addition it was recommended to
restart low-dose Toprol 25 mg PO once daily for low EF.
Dialysis was considered. A decision was made to hold off on
dialysis and to monitor urine output and creatinine. Repeat
duplex revealed no hydro, no perinephric fluid collection.
Arterial wave forms were normal. The renal vein appeared to
have a biphasic flow pattern consistent with right heart
failure.

Given the stabilization of creatinine to 4.1, BUN of 106, and
urine output of 700 cc, it was decided to discharge the
patient to home on Prograf 2.5 mg twice a day for Prograf
level of 8.9. CellCept [**Pager number **] mg QID, to monitor the patient for
the next few days. The patient was to be seen 2 days post
discharge in the transplant office after a.m. labs were to be
drawn. He was cleared by physical therapy. He was tolerating
PO intake with a fair intake. Vital signs were stable.
Visiting nurse was set up for home PT. Given the patient
appeared somewhat depressed, it was felt that he would
benefit by being at home with a hope that nutritional intake
would improve in home environment.

VNA was consulted to continue wound care. It was noted that
the patient had a 2.5 x 1.5 cm right gluteal stage 2 pressure
ulcer as well as a 2 x 1.5 cm inferior pressure ulcer on the
right gluteal area. Recommendations by wound skin care nurse
were to cleanse with normal saline, apply DuoDerm gel to the
open areas, with no-sting barrier wipe to peri-wound skin and
then leave in foam adhesive 4 x 4 dressing to be changed
every 3 days. These recommendations were conveyed to the VNA
for outpatient management. The patient was discharged with a
rolling walker to home to have physical therapy at home per
recommendations.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Volume overload.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old man
status post living-unrelated transplant [**2153-9-5**].
Transplant was difficult due to severe atherosclerotic
disease of aorta to iliac vessels. Postoperatively,
ultrasound demonstrated reasonable arterial flow, but the
renal vein was unable to be visualized. The patient was
brought back to the OR on [**2153-9-6**] for exploration of
kidney, which demonstrated no evidence of renal vein
thrombosis.

On [**2153-10-7**], the patient presented with increased
weight gain, lower extremity edema, nausea, vomiting. Patient
after postop course was remarkable for DGF (ATN) and the
patient reports making approximately 1100 cc of urine per
day. Creatinine and BUN have been relatively elevated, BUN in
the 90s, creatinine 4.0 postoperatively. Patient also reports
dysuria. Patient complains of shortness of breath, dizziness,
lightheadedness. The patient has approximately 3 loose bowel
movements per day. Decreased appetite but stable. Three pound
weight gain over the last few days. Lasix was increased
recently to 80 once daily without improvement. No
hemodialysis postoperatively.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease status post
living-unrelated transplant [**2153-9-5**] complicated by
poor arterial flow, status post exploration of kidney [**2153-9-6**], history of type 1 diabetes with complications,
complicated by retinopathy requiring bilateral laser surgery,
as well as right vitrectomy, history of neuropathy in both
hands and legs, history of CVA with some left-sided weakness,
history of CAD, history of MI on several occasions in the
past and 6 stents placed since [**2152-7-4**], history of PVD with
bilateral lower extremity bypass and toe amputation
bilaterally, status post myocardial infarctions, also has a
history of ejection fraction of 20%, GERD.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy, status post living-
unrelated renal transplant [**2153-9-5**], with exploration
of kidney on [**2153-9-6**], status post bilateral lower
extremity bypass, status post toe amputation bilaterally,
status post placement of 6 cardiac stents in [**2152**].

MEDICATION ON ADMISSION:  Tacrolimus 2 and 2, MMF 500 q.i.d.,
Valcyte 450 every other day, Bactrim SS 1 tab once daily,
nystatin S and S 5 cc p.o. q.i.d., Protonix 40 mg once daily,
Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Toprol XL 25 mg once daily, Lasix 40 mg
once daily, PhosLo tabs, Plavix 75 once daily, rapamycin 2 mg
once daily.

ALLERGIES:  Ativan and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 96.8, heart rate 80, 114/68, 96
room air. No acute distress, awake, alert, oriented x3.
Cranial nerves grossly intact. CV regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at bilateral base, right
greater than left. Abdomen: Well-healed incision, soft,
nontender, nondistended. Extremities: [**4-6**]+ pitting edema.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a WBC of 1.9, hematocrit
of 33.2, PT of 13.9, PTT 27.8, platelets 240, sodium 129, K
4.2, chloride 91, bicarbonate 24, BUN and creatinine 81 and
4.1, glucose 230.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So, the patient was admitted. Renal was
consulted. Patient was given IV Lasix. Plan was discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Chest x-ray obtained on [**2153-10-7**]
demonstrating failure with bilateral effusions consistent
with fluid overload. On [**2153-10-8**], an ultrasound was
obtained of the kidney, duplex ultrasound, demonstrating
normal appearance of the renal transplant with normal
resistive indices ranging from 0.60 to 0.69, and also comment
about bilateral pleural effusions.

Patient went to ultrafiltration on [**2153-10-7**]. Patient
does have a left AV fistula which ultrafiltration was
performed through that. A 2-D echo was performed on [**2153-10-9**] demonstrating ejection fraction less than 20%,
compared with prior study that was reviewed on [**2152-6-27**].
Right ventricle is now dilated with freewall hypokinesis, and
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure has
increased. Severity of mitral regurg and pulmonary artery
hypotension are also increased.

The patient continued with tacrolimus, rapamycin, MMF,
Valcyte. Cardiology was consulted. Cardiology met with
patient and felt that patient should be on aspirin, Plavix.
Suggested adjustment changes to medications. Agreed with 80
mg of IV Lasix for goal weight to be -1 to 2 liters. Wound
care nurse met with patient on [**2153-10-9**] because of
sacral pressure ulcers, in which the patient had a right
gluteal, left gluteal pressure ulcer, and made
recommendations in regards to dressing changes. A right foot
x-ray was obtained because of a right heel ulcer,
demonstrating that there was no radiologic evidence of
osteomyelitis.

On [**2153-10-11**], a right-sided ultrasound-guided
thoracentesis performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], in which
they removed 1300 cc of clear serosanguineous fluid. There
were no complications. During hospitalization, patient had
CMV viral load sent off which demonstrated that CMV-DNA was
not detected. On [**2153-10-11**], the patient had a cardiac
cath performed demonstrating baseline moderate-severe
elevation in right heart pressures with low cardiac index.
With dopamine infusion, no change in PCX and PA pressures, or
systolic blood pressure, with progressive increase in cardiac
index. A right HT left in place for continued hemodynamic
monitoring in the CCU with drug therapy.

So, the patient was on the cardiac service for monitoring,
and transplant saw the patient daily and also managed his
immune suppressant medications. Wound care frequently saw
patient for his decubitus pressure ulcers on his gluteus and
right heel. Infectious disease was consulted because of
fevers, and blood cultures were sent on [**2153-10-14**],
in which a blood culture, sputum culture and urine culture
were sent off, as well as a catheter-tip from PA line. All
were unremarkable except for blood culture on [**2153-10-14**] demonstrating Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient was
placed on Flagyl, Zosyn, vancomycin on [**2153-10-15**],
after he had a temperature and ID made recommendations. The
patient started having diarrhea, so C. diff was sent off
demonstrating no C. diff, no ova and parasites on [**2153-10-16**]. Repeat CMV viral load was obtained demonstrating
not detected.

Podiatry came to see patient on [**2153-10-16**] for his
right heel ulcer. Physical therapy/ occupational therapy saw
patient and were consulted. On [**2153-10-16**], patient
had ultrafiltration through his left upper extremity fistula.
He tolerated the procedure well. The patient was changed from
multiple antibiotics to meropenem, continued on Lasix.
Patient had repeat blood cultures on [**2153-10-17**] which
demonstrated no growth. On [**2153-10-19**], urine culture
obtained demonstrated no growth as well. Patient continued on
ultrafiltration on [**2153-10-17**]. Also, patient had
ultrafiltration on [**2153-10-19**], in which 1.5 L of
fluid removed. Patient's Lasix drip was discontinued on
[**2153-10-19**]. Patient was started on Epogen for anemia.

Patient was transferred from cardiac service to transplant
service on [**2153-10-21**], since patient was stable from
a cardiac standpoint, but cardiology was still continuing to
see patient. On [**2153-10-23**], the patient had a PICC
line placed for IV antibiotics, and also had his
ultrafiltration as well. Serial chest x-rays demonstrated
improved CHF. On [**2153-10-23**], placement of PICC line
demonstrates that there was more slightly prominent right
pleural effusion, satisfactory position to right-sided PICC
line, and this film was compared to a previous film. Question
whether or not it was due to position, but because patient
had very good saturations of 96-97% on room air, that
clinically patient had no new findings of shortness of
breath, chest pain which he did not require any oxygen, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] felt safely with confidence that the patient could go
home. Patient was transitioned from FK to rapamycin while
patient was an inpatient, and since the patient has been
here, he has been on a single dose of rapamycin 6 mg once
daily. Levels range from 7.3 to [**10-23**] which was 10.9.

So, even though patient was deconditioned and physical
therapy thought he should go to rehab, his wife who is an ICU
nurse felt strongly that she could take care of him with
services at home. So, the patient was discharged to home with
services on the following medications: tamsulosin 0.4 mg at
bedtime, calcium acetate 667--2 tabs t.i.d. with meals,
Bactrim SS 1 tab once daily, Protonix 40 mg q. 24, aspirin
325 mg once daily, Tylenol 325--1-2 tablets q. [**5-9**] h. p.r.n.,
Plavix 75 mg once daily, MMF 250 b.i.d., Ambien 1 mg at
bedtime, Valcyte 450 every other day, Epogen 4000 units q.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, B-Complex, Vitamin C, folic
acid, isosorbide 1 tablet t.i.d., nystatin 10 mL p.o. q.i.d.,
tacrolimus 6 mg once daily, metolazone 10 mg once daily,
bumetanide 3 mg b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg once daily, also
meropenem 500 mg q. 12 for 2 days, and ciprofloxacin 500 mg
once daily x4 days. Patient will also be on an insulin fixed
dose of 5 units of NPH for breakfast and 4 units for dinner,
and also sliding scale.

Patient has a [**Hospital 39569**] hospital bed at home. Patient has
PICC line care, IV pole pump, saline flushes, heparin
flushes. Physical activity can be weightbearing. The patient
is follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week.
Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for an appointment. Patient should follow-
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] which is his cardiologist in [**Location (un) 47**].
Patient should have wound care to his gluteal area and to his
right heel with DuoDerm gel and Aloe [**Doctor First Name **] ointment to his
heel with protective gauze. The patient should follow-up with
his podiatrist in [**Location (un) 47**] as soon as possible for an
appointment. Also, patient's wife should call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
this Friday for record of his weight since being home and
report that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**].

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  A 54-year-old status post living-unrelated
transplant with congestive heart failure/fluid overload.

MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES:
1.  Cardiac catheterization to evaluate pulmonary pressures.
2.  Peripherally inserted central catheter line placement for
    bacteremia, specific organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Transfer for high-risk cardiac
intervention.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 86 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus and
hypertension, who was in his usual state of health until 2
a.m. the morning of [**2178-8-2**], when he awoke with
shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  At that time, he took
Combivent without help and went back to sleep.  He then again
awoke at 04:00 a.m. with worsening dyspnea that was not
responsive to his Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  At that
time, he then went to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital where he was
treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation with Solu-Medrol, Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers
and antibiotics.  While at [**Hospital3 1280**], he had an episode of
acute shortness of breath and at that time it was felt that
that he was in flash pulmonary edema.

An EKG on [**2178-8-3**], showed transient anterior ST
elevations and T wave inversions.  At this time, his cardiac
enzymes were positive with a peak creatinine kinase of 202 on
[**2178-8-4**].  Cardiac catheterization at this time
revealed the following:  Left main with 80% stenosis; right
coronary artery 70% ostial lesion; patent ductus arteriosus
80% lesion; diffuse left anterior descending and left
circumflex disease.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for possible PCI versus
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and they
felt that he was a poor surgical candidate given his history
of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; thus, the
management of these lesions were those of undergoing a PCI of
the right coronary artery and left main.

The patient's post catheterization course had also been
complicated by a right groin hematoma.  A subsequent
ultrasound was negative for pseudo-aneurysm, and a CT scan of
the abdomen was also negative for retroperitoneal bleed.  The
patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Team
for which he actually went to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further monitoring in anticipation of high risk left main
coronary artery intervention on [**2178-8-6**].

Upon transfer to the Floor, the patient continued to
experience shortness of breath and was given Albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers with minimal relief.  The patient was
then given 40 mg intravenously of Lasix and had minimal urine
output.  The patient was then stared on Bi-PAP on 14/9 with
improvement of dyspnea and O2 saturation of 96%.

Upon initial evaluation by the Coronary Care Unit team the
patient was resting comfortably on Bi-PAP mask and denying
any chest pain.

Of note, prior to this hospitalization, the patient had
noticed a recent increase in his lower extremity swelling and
a productive cough.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2178-8-4**], please see HPI for findings.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient has

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  On admission, the patient is an 86 year
old male with known three-vessel coronary artery disease
including left main disease, severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
peripheral vascular disease, who was admitted for high-risk
cardiac catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Upon admission, the patient was
continued on aspirin, Captopril, nifedipine and Lipitor.  The
patient was weaned off of the Nitroglycerin drip.  Beta
blockers were held secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and the GTB3A inhibitors were held secondary to his
right groin hematoma.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and
remained flat and there was no evidence of acute ischemia on
his repeat electrocardiograms.

On hospital day number two, the patient was taken to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and stents were placed to
his left main, 4.5 centimeters; right coronary artery (4.5
millimeters to 13 millimeters) and posterior descending
artery (2.5 millimeters by 18 millimeters).  The patient was
then continued on Integrilin for the next 18 hours.

Of note, the patient was switched from nifedipine to
Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient then continued to
remain chest pain free throughout the remainder of his
hospital course and was chest pain free up to the projected
discharge date.

Myocardium:  The patient's ejection fraction at the outside
hospital showed a 60% preserved ejection fraction and his ACE
inhibitors were titrated up throughout this hospital stay as
tolerated.

Rhythm:  The patient had no rhythm issues throughout the
majority of his hospital stay.  However, of note, the two
nights prior to discharge, the patient had a 13 beat run of
nonsustaining ventricular tachycardia.  The patient was
asymptomatic at the time, with stable vital signs and it
occurred while the patient was sleeping. The patient
continued to be monitored rigorously on Telemetry for signs
of any further episodes of ventricular tachycardia.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient had severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease with FEV1 of less than 1.  The patient was
continued on his Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q. six
hours with Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers q. four hours as
needed p.r.n.  The patient was also continued on Bi-PAP
overnight as needed, and a Prednisone taper was begun at the
time of admission.  The patient reported remaining slightly
below or near his baseline as far as his subjective symptoms
of dyspnea throughout the hospital course, and will be
discharged on his current outpatient regimen.

3.  Renal:  The patient was admitted with mild renal
insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.1.  His creatinine was
monitored throughout the course of his hospital stay and his
kidney function actually improved status post myocardial
infarction with improvement in his hemodynamics.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has diabetes mellitus of unknown
duration with complications at this time unknown.  He was
continued on four times a day fingersticks and on a Regular
insulin sliding scale throughout his hospital stay, with
excellent control of his blood pressures throughout the
hospital course.

5.  Hematology:  As per HPI the patient was admitted with a
resolving hematoma of his right groin area that was negative
for pseudo-aneurysm or retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient's

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat revealed racoon eyes, bleeding from
oropharynx.  Multiple contusions.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Respiratory was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  The pelvis was stable.  Extremities
revealed right knee bruising and right hand bruising.  Back
revealed negative stepoff, negative deformities.  Rectal was
guaiac-negative with good rectal tone.   Vital signs revealed
temperature was 99.8, pulse was 86, blood pressure
was 136/67, 61% on ventilator.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Hematocrit
was 30.6, platelets were 219.  INR was 1.3.  Arterial blood
gas was 7.36/40/97/24/-2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray was negative.

Pelvis was poor quality but no fractures.

Cervical spine was negative to C5.

A CT of the head was negative.

A CT of the cervical spine was negative.

A CT of the face showed bilateral facial fractures and nasal
fractures.

X-ray of the right knee was negative; right hand was
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 84-year-old female with
multiple facial fractures who was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for monitoring.  The patient was to have repeat
pelvis films to assess for further fractures.

On hospital day one, the patient was stable in the Intensive
Care Unit.  A Plastic Surgery consultation concluded that the
nasal fracture was displaced and would need reduction.  In
the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was sedated with
propofol and reduced using a #3 blade handle and Vaseline
gauze.  The reduced nasal fracture was then splinted with
Steri-strips.

Plastic Surgery recommended that the nasal area should be
packed in roughly four to five days.  A splint should stay on
for seven days, and the patient should follow up with Plastic
Surgery in roughly one week following discharge.  The Plastic
Surgery Clinic telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 274**].  They also
concluded that the maxillary sinus fractures did not need to
be surgically addressed.

Orthopaedics was also consulted on the patient prior to
performing adequate pelvic x-rays.  They concluded that the
inlet and outlet views of the pelvis showed no fractures, and
that the femurs were also intact and without fractures.  They
recommended follow up as needed, and there was no acute
injuries.

During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, her blood sugars ran
fairly high in the 250-range to 300-range; at which time her
insulin sliding-scale was readjusted.

The rest of the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay was
relatively uneventful, and the patient was transferred to the
floor without complications.

The patient's stay on the Surgical floor was also uneventful
and consisted mostly of rehabilitation planning.  During her
stay, the patient's Foley was removed.  Her diet was
advanced, and Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy saw
the patient.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**9-14**], the patient was
discharged to rehabilitation services.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Discharge physical
revealed temperature maximum was 98.7/98, pulse was 68, blood
pressure was 148/70, respiratory was 18, oxygen saturation
was 97% on room air.  In general, in no acute distress.
Facial ecchymosis.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate
and rhythm.  Respiratory was clear to auscultation.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities
revealed no peripheral edema.

Date of Birth:   [**2050-1-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Fernard Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
female with no significant past medical history who presented
to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with acute onset of respiratory
distress.  The patient had been noticing an enlarging neck
mass for the past three to four years.  As [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital notes, the patient noticed increasing phlegm
production two days prior to admission and increasing
shortness of breath.  She was being evaluated by
Otorhinolaryngology as an outpatient and sent to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital for head/neck/chest computerized tomography scan.
While in the Waiting Room the patient had an acute onset of
respiratory distress requiring intubation and was admitted to
the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital Intensive Care Unit.  Because the
outside hospital was unable to provide radiation, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**].

100 cc of necrotic material was aspirated from the left neck
mass which by report is consistent with squamous cell
carcinoma.  Computerized tomography scan of the neck/chest
revealed a 7 by 7 cm left-sided neck mass with deviation of
the trachea to the right and compression of the trachea
around the endotracheal tube.  No obvious tumor was seen in
the chest computerized tomography scan.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications as an outpatient, none.
Medications on transfer were Heparin subcutaneously, Morphine
and Ativan prn.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with one son and her
grandson.  She quit tobacco 30 years ago and smoked less than
half a pack per day for a few years.  She denies alcohol use.
She works at [**Company **] and was working prior to her
Otorhinolaryngology visit.  Before that she worked for 14
years at a Stride-Rite Factory gluing soles to bottom of
shoes.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies at an outside hospital
revealed sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate
31, BUN 7, creatinine .8, glucose 128, white blood cell count
8.2, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 300, LDH 228.  Arterial blood
gases, pressor support ventilation of 10 and 5 is 7.54, 27,
and greater than 250.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination vital signs
were 100.2, heartrate 98, blood pressure 141/93, respiratory
rate 14 and oxygen saturations 100%.  In general the patient
is an elderly female in no apparent distress, awake, and
answering questions.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat,
extraocular muscles intact.  Pupils, equal and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Large left-sided neck mass,
nontender, approximately 8 by 8 cm.  Small 1 cm area of
ecchymosis around the biopsy site.  Heart, normal S1 and S2,
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen obese, soft, nontender, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

RADIOGRAPHS:  Chest x-ray from outside hospital, large left
neck mass with questionable mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
endotracheal tube at carina.  Chest computerized tomography
scan without contrast, large neck mass, 7 by 7 in diameter,
left trachea shifted to right, trachea compressed around
endotracheal tube.  Computerized tomography scan of chest
revealed multiple anterior mediastinal lymph nodes and
para-aortic tracheal compression with deviation to the right,
no parenchymal lung lesions are seen, small left pleural
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old female with
left-sided neck mass consistent with squamous cell carcinoma,
most likely of esophageal origin, causing airway compromise,
intubated for airway protection.

1.  Left-sided neck mass - On arrival to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was evaluated by
Radiation [**Hospital 44889**] Medical Oncology and Otorhinolaryngology.
It was felt given the size of the mass that extubation could
not be done safely without further securing the airway.  The
patient had a computerized tomography scan of the neck and
chest with contrast and an magnetic resonance imaging scan of
the chest which revealed the following.  Computerized
tomography scan of the head revealed no evidence of
intracranial metastatic disease.  Computerized tomography
scan of the chest showed a large neck mass which tracks along
the posterior wall of the trachea into the thoracic inlet,
measuring 7 by 11 cm, multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph
nodes and a small lower thoracic vertebral body hemangioma.
The magnetic resonance imaging scan of the neck with
gadolinium showed redemonstration of an enormous neck mass
with probable infiltration in the region of the left carotid
sheath and other signs of spread.

In light of these findings, the patient was scheduled for
Operating Room placement of a tracheostomy.  The patient was
sent to the Operating Room on [**2119-10-26**], hospital day
#9.  In the Operating Room the procedure was noted to be very
difficult and a tracheoesophageal fistula was found.  The
patient's trachea was dissected to the fifth tracheal ring
and an endotracheal tube was placed instead of a stable
tracheostomy tube, given the difficulty of the procedure.  On
hospital day #10, the patient had an open gastrostomy tube
placed and a Port-A-Cath placed by General Surgery.  A
panendoscopy was done at the time of her tracheostomy
placement on hospital day #10 which showed diffuse tumor in
both the trachea and the esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were
done of the esophagus and it was felt at this time that the
tumor was originating from the cervical esophagus, although
this could not be definitely confirmed.

On the day after gastrostomy tube and Port-A-Cath placement,
extensive discussions were taken with the family.
Interventional Pulmonology was consulted for possible
stenting of the esophageal tracheal fistula, however, given
the location it was felt that no stent could be placed in
either the esophagus or the trachea at this time.  Given the
poor prognosis with the extent of disease, complicated by the
tracheoesophageal fistula, the decision on whether to pursue
radiation and chemotherapy was in question.  The patient met
with both radiation oncology and medical oncology and was
told about the risks and benefits of treatment.  Given the
fistula, it was thought that radiation and chemotherapy,
while possibly able to provide some local control of tumor
extension, would only worsen the fistula and cause
neutropenia increasing infection risk.  The patient decided
that she wanted to not pursue chemotherapy and radiation
therapy and would want to go home with home hospice care.
The patient was also made Do-Not-Resuscitate at this time.

Given the unusual nature of the patient's tracheostomy tube,
a customized tracheostomy was ordered and is currently
enroute to the hospital.  The patient is to have a more
permanent airway placed on Wednesday, [**11-8**].  If the
patient is able to tolerate the patient and her airway
remains stable, she should be able to be discharged home with
maximal home services.

During this hospitalization palliative care was consulted to
aid in placement and home services.  They are currently
following the patient and have already provided some possible
resources for the patient.

2.  Tracheobronchitis -  On hospital day #2 the patient had a
bronchoscopy to evaluate for any intrinsic compression of
airways by the neck mass.  Airways appeared patent below the
endotracheal tube, however, numerous secretions were seen.
BAL later grew out Staphylococcus aureus which was
pansensitive.  The patient completed a ten-day course of
Levaquin and Clindamycin which was later added after the
tracheal esophageal fistula was found.  Currently, the
patient has occasional secretions and lowgrade temperatures,
however, secretions overall have decreased this admission and
the patient's cough has not increased.  We will try to
observe the patient off of antibiotics but anticipate that
she may continue to have lowgrade fevers due to her
tracheoesophageal fistula and extent of tumor burden.

3.  Urinary tract infection - The patient had an urinary
tract infection during this admission which was Escherichia
coli pansensitive.  The patient was treated with Levaquin,
and subsequent cultures have remained negative.  The Foley
catheter was discontinued on hospital day #19.

4.  Thrush - It was noted that the patient has several
plaques on her tongue and was started on Nystatin Swish and
Swallow which will have to continue while at home.

5.  Constipation - It was noted that the patient had multiple
episodes of constipation in the setting of Roxicet narcotic
use for incisional pain.  This has resolved with an adequate
bowel regimen.

6.  Physical therapy - The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy who felt that the patient may be able to be
discharged home with maximal services.  The patient has been
ambulating without complications.

7.  Respiratory status - The patient was initially on vent
support, however, this was slowly weaned during her hospital
course and she is currently on a T-piece 24 hours a day
without any necessary vent support.  She should be able to go
home with a similar apparatus.  She no longer needs any vent
support.

8.  Tubes, lines and drains - The patient has had her Foley
catheter discontinued.  She has a Port-A-Cath which has been
deaccessed and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube.  She is currently receiving tube feeds 24 hours a day
at 60 cc/hr.

9.  Code status - The patient is currently
Do-Not-Resuscitate.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Stage 4 cervical esophageal cancer
2.  Airway compromise, status post tracheostomy
3.  Tracheobronchitis
4.  Urinary tract infection
5.  Thrush
6.  Constipation

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is an 84-year-old
male who felt dizzy, lost extremity function, and had an
syncopal episode and was taken to outside hospital.  He
denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea on
exertion, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The patient
was found down for five minutes and then was awake, alert,
and oriented times three.

Again, he was taken to an outside hospital where his
troponins were flat.  He was started on heparin and brought
here.  He was taken to the cardiac catheterization where he
was found to have multivessel disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   (His past medical history is
significant for)
1.  Hypertension.
2.  High cholesterol.
3.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarction in [**2085**].
4.  Anemia.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6.  He has a history of tachy-brady arrhythmia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (His medications included)
1.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Zocor 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Nitroglycerin paste as needed.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, he was afebrile.  His vital signs were stable.
He was slightly bradycardic.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart revealed sinus
bradycardia.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Bowel sounds were
present.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with no
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was taken to the operating room on
[**2105-7-31**] where a coronary artery bypass graft times
two was performed with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to first
obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to second obtuse
marginal.  The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Recovery Unit postoperatively.

Prior to being taken to the operating room, he had a carotid
Duplex bilaterally which showed no significant disease which
needed surgical intervention at that time.

The patient was slowly weaned from his ventilator and was
extubated on postoperative day one, and he continued to
improve.  He was started on beta blockers, and his pain was
controlled with Percocet.

Physical Therapy was consulted while the patient was in the
Intensive Care Unit to assess for ambulation and for cardiac
rehabilitation.  They felt that he would benefit most by
going to cardiac rehabilitation and to continue his followup
here in the hospital.  His pacing was slowly weaned, which he
tolerated while having occasional sinus bradycardia.  His
chest tubes were removed, and the patient continued to
improve.  His pain improved with the chest tube removal, and
his Foley was also removed at that time, and he was
transferred to the floor on [**2105-8-4**].

He continued to be seen by Physical Therapy and improved on
the floor.  His pain was controlled.  His wires were removed
postoperatively with no significant complications, and he did
well.  At the time of this dictation, he was awaiting
rehabilitation position.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (His planned medications on
discharge included)
1.  Simvastatin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4h. as needed.
3.  Motrin 400 mg p.o. q.4-6h. as needed.
4.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary
care physician in one to two weeks.
2.  To follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in four weeks.

Date of Birth:   [**2159-11-10**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Neonatology
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby [**Known lastname 47229**] is a preterm infant
admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit born at 27 [**2-25**]
week gestation to a 28 year old gravida 1, para 0 mom with a
nonremarkable prenatal screen.  Group B Streptotoccus is
unknown.  Antepartum was remarkable for twin gestation with
weeks for contractions.  She received Betamethasone course at
that time.  She was treated with magnesium sulfate and
ampicillin.  She was readmitted to Labor and Delivery on the
day of admission with a new onset of contractions, treated
with Ampicillin six hours prior to delivery.  The decision
was made at that time to deliver for possible chorio with a
white blood count of 26,000.  Cesarean section was done under
age with a 300 oxygen.  Apgars were 5, 7 and 8.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination at admission showed a pink
vigorous baby with an endotracheal tube in place.  The
physical examination was remarkable for moderate retractions
with poor air entry with good perfusion and tone.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for treatment of
hyaline membrane disease with mechanical ventilation as well
as rule out sepsis and prematurity.

Respiratory - The baby was put on mechanical ventilation on
admission and given Surfactant times two and by approximately
day of life #3 was extubated to CPAP without any incidents.
The baby was loaded with caffeine for apnea of prematurity as
well.  For the next month, the baby continued to require
intermittent CPAP/nasal cannula. During that time, intermittent
administration of Lasix was also given with minimal help.
The oxygen requirement on baby boy [**Name (NI) 47229**] was as low as 100%
at 100 cc to a CPAP of 6.  At the time of this dictation, the
baby has been on a consistent amount, 200 to 400 cc of oxygen
(200 cc of oxygen in the past 48 hours) and is stable.
Oxygen requirements at the time were 200 to 300 cc, 30 to
50%, at the time of this dictation oxygen requirement has
been decreased to nasal cannula 35 to 50% oxygen at 300 cc
and the baby is on caffeine.

On [**12-18**], because of his persistent oxygen requirement
and the evolvement of chronic lung disease, a single dose of
Lasix was given to Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 47229**] with hope of clinical
improvement.  The oxygen requirement, however, did not
improve.  Due to his good growth status at the time it was
decided to go ahead and decrease his total fluid intake to
130 cc/kg/day.  We believe due to his good growth status his
decreased caloric intake would actually not play a big role
in his growth.  We hope that this input will help decrease
the progression of his chronic lung disease.  We opted to do
this in place of starting him on diuretic therapy.

Cardiovascular - From a cardiovascular standpoint, Baby
[**Known lastname 47229**] was hemodynamically stable initially. Umbilical
artery, umbilical vein line was placed initially and there
was no need for vasopressors.  There was, however, a murmur
that was heard in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**] that prompted an
echocardiogram.  The echocardiogram showed a patent ductus
arteriosus that appeared to be hemodynamically significant.
This was also supported with evidence of a slightly enlarged
heart on chest x-ray as well as increasing oxygen requirement
(from nasal cannula to CPAP).  A course of Indomethacin was
given with some good clinical improvement.  There was,
however, a residual murmur that was heard after the
Indomethacin course.  A repeat echocardiogram shows a very
small restricted patent ductus arteriosus which we felt was
not significant enough to give the patient the respiratory
symptomatology.  We felt that at that time the respiratory
symptomatology, i.e. oxygen requirement was more likely due
to the evolving chronic lung disease.  Hemodynamically
speaking the baby remained stable with a normal pulse.  There
was no evidence of acidosis or hypotension as would be the
case with a hemodynamically significant patent ductus
arteriosus.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - From a fluid standpoint,
the patient was advanced on fluids in the usual manner.  The
patient was on parenteral nutrition for a short while.  The
patient was made NPO during the course of Indomethacin.  The
enteral feedings were quickly restarted and advanced to full
feeds following the Indomethacin course without any
incidents.  Electrolyte and nutrition laboratory studies
were within satisfactory limits.  By the time of this
dictation, the patient was on PE30 with ProMod with good
evidence of growth.  At the time of this dictation, the baby
has shown good weight gain at [**2126**] gm.

Neurology - From a neurological standpoint the baby's head
ultrasound has been within normal limits, the last one of
which was on [**12-13**].  Eye examination on [**2159-12-20**]
shows Stage 1, zone 2 to 3 with ophthalmological
recommendation follow up in two weeks.

Heme - From a hematological standpoint, initially the baby's
hematocrit was satisfactory.  It did go as low into the 20s
which did require a blood transfusion.  This was done without
any complications and appeared to actually have helped in the
clinical picture.

Infectious disease - From an infection standpoint, the baby
did receive a seven day course of antibiotics.  There was
initial complete blood count which shows a neutropenia and
relative bandemia.  This quickly resolved since the baby at
no time did show any clinical evidence of bacteremia and
sepsis.  All cultures have been negative including the lumbar
puncture.  The ampicillin and gentamicin were discontinued
after seven days without any clinical sequela.

Social - At the time of this dictation, there is discussion
as to transition the baby to [**Hospital3 **] where the
baby can further receive the appropriate Level 2 type care

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular/respiratory:  Baby girl
[**Known lastname 24022**] was stable cardiovascularly from admission.  She
required no cardiovascular interventions and was transferred
without any cardiovascular concerns.  Respiratory, baby girl
[**Name (NI) 24022**] was admitted with mild respiratory distress.  She
required no intervention and was initially in room air and
tachypneic with a respiratory rates in the 50s to 80s,
however, her tachypnea resolved over the course of the
following day and she had good oxygen saturations with
respiratory rates in the 30s to 50s with only mild
retractions within 24 hours subsequent.  On the day of
transfer [**2106-4-9**] she was without respiratory distress,
comfortable with respiratory rates in the 30s to 50s on room
air with oxygen saturations greater then 96%.  She has had no
history of apnea, bradycardia or desaturations as well.  She
is transferred to the Newborn Nursery without any respiratory
concerns.

2.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initially baby girl
[**Name (NI) 24022**] number two was NPO and put on intravenous fluids
of D10W running through a PIV at 80 cc per kilogram per day.
As her respiratory distress resolved she was started on ad
lib feeds on [**2106-4-7**] and advanced to ad lib feeds of
approximately 100 cc per kilo per day by [**2106-4-9**].  She is
nippling all of her feeds, requires minimal support and it is
expected that her volumes will advance as she becomes older.
Her urine output and stool output have been adequate. She has
had no electrolyte instabilities.

3.  Hematologic/Infectious diseases:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 24022**]
was initially on a rule out sepsis pathway with a blood
culture and a CBC obtained on admission.  She was started on
Ampicillin and Gentamycin and remained on Ampicillin and
Gentamycin for 48 hours after which these antibiotics were
discontinued secondary to a negative blood culture.  Her
initial CBC was benign with a total white count of 9200 white
blood cells per microliter with a differential of 15%
segmented neutrophils and 0% bands.  Her hematocrit was 55%
and her platelets count was 30,100 per microliter.  No
subsequent CBCs were obtained.

This is an addendum for the time period from the previous
transfer dictation from [**2106-4-9**] through [**2106-4-16**].  For
details of the patient and the patient's admission history,
please see the previous transfer dictation.

[**Hospital **] HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  1. Cardiovascular:  Baby
Girl [**Known lastname 24022**] has been cardiovascularly stable through the
time period from [**2106-4-9**] through [**2106-4-16**].  She has had no
cardiovascular instability and is discharged to home in
stable cardiovascular condition.

2. Respiratory:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 24022**] was in stable
respiratory status for the time period from [**2106-4-9**] through
[**2106-4-16**].  She had several episodes of spontaneous
desaturation during the time period from [**2106-4-10**] through
[**2106-4-11**].  These were small in number and were not
accompanied by apnea or bradycardia.  At least some if not
all of these episodes were associated with feeding.  She has
not had any desaturations, apnea or bradycardia from the time
period from [**2106-4-12**] through [**2106-4-16**] and it is not
anticipated that she will have any continuing problems such
as these.  Of note, her desaturations were self-resolving and
short in duration.  She is thus discharged to home in stable
respiratory status.

3. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 24022**]
was on a total fluid regimen of 150 cc per kg per day.  She
was feeding with premature Enfamil 24 without difficulty.
She was feeding all by mouth without any need for gavage for
many days prior to discharge and was taking approximately 165
cc per kg per day on the three days prior to her discharge.
She has been growing well and her discharge weight is 1,820
grams.  She has had no difficulties with voiding or stooling
and is discharged to home without any concerns regarding her
fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.

4. Hematologic/infectious diseases:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 24022**]
has had no difficulties with hematologic or infectious
disease issues and is discharged to home in stable status.
She is to receive hepatitis B immunization once she reaches 2
kg in weight.

5. Condition on discharge:  Good.

6. Discharge disposition:  Home.

7. Discharge diet:  Ad lib premature Enfamil 24.

8. Discharge medications:  None.

9. Car seat test:  Passed.

10. Hearing screen:  Passed.

11. Immunizations received:  None.  As noted above she has
yet to receive her first hepatitis B immunization which she
will be eligible for when she reaches 2 kg in weight.  Of
note, Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from
[**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who are born between 32 and
35 weeks gestational age with plans for day care during the
RSV season with a smoker in the household or with preschool
siblings.  As Baby Girl [**Known lastname 24022**] was born at approximately
34-5/7 weeks gestation, she would meet this criteria and RSV
prophylaxis should be considered should she meet any of the
previously stated criteria.  Likewise the influenza vaccine

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a history of hypertension who presented from an
outside hospital with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction in
the inferior and posterior segments.

The patient had multiple episodes of nausea, chest pressure,
chest discomfort, and epigastric pain over the past two weeks
prior to admission.  Each episode lasted approximately one
hour.  The pain and episodes were stuttering in duration and
progression.  The pain radiated to her back and neck and was
associated with shortness of breath.  The patient also had
shortness of breath at rest.

She presented to an outside hospital where her
electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block
with ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF; ST depressions
in leads I, aVL, V2 through V6.  She was placed on aspirin,
heparin, nitroglycerin, Lopressor, and Integrilin with near
resolution of anginal symptoms.

The patient was then transferred via helicopter to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for emergent catheterization.
An interventional heart catheterization was performed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] which demonstrated a right-dominant coronary
circulation with left main coronary artery with a 30% tubular
ostial calcification, left anterior descending artery 70%
proximal lesion, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30272**] diseased first diagonal, left
circumflex with 99% long stenosis involving the
origin/proximal portion of first obtuse marginal which filled
retrograde by left-to-left collaterals; likely very chronic
but contributory to anterolateral ST depressions noted on
electrocardiograms prior to transfer.  The right coronary
artery with initial TIMI-II flow, sequential 90% tubular then
90% ulcerated hazy lesions just before short posterior
descending artery (with 90% ostial) and large posterior left
ventricular branches.  Post Angio-Jet predilation 3 balloon,
Lopressor, and deployment of 3.5 X 33 Hepakote [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 30272**]
posterior descending artery jailed and lost, unable to engage
with base, right coronary artery 0% residual stenosis,
TIMI-III flow.

While transferring the patient to the stretcher status post
catheterization, the patient was given a tablet of Plavix and
became extraordinarily anxious upon attempting to swallow the
pill.  She then raised her heart rate to the 140s.  Her blood
pressure went to 240/130, and the patient went into flash
pulmonary edema.  She was given Lasix 40 mg intravenously
times two and a nitroglycerin 200-mcg bolus followed by a
nitroglycerin drip at 250 mcg/kg per minute.  She was also
Fentanyl 25 mcg for anxiety.  She also reported wheezing
after being given a beta blocker.  At that time, the
patient's blood pressure was at 189/101, and she was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
at the time of admission revealed heart rate was 122, blood
pressure was 189/101, respiratory rate was 20, and the
patient was saturating at 89% on 100% nonrebreather mask.  In
general, an elderly female producing pink frothy sputum,
mildly uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  On neck examination, unable to assess
jugular venous pulsation.  The lungs revealed rales all the
way bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, clicks, or
gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis, and radial  pulses were
2+ bilaterally.  No presacral or lower extremity edema.  The
right groin catheterization site was without hematoma or
bruits.  It was clean, dry, and intact.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Moved
all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 119,
bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine
was 1, and blood glucose was 122.  Initial INR was 1.3.
Blood gas revealed 7.37/34/71.  Creatine kinase was [**2118**].

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital showed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads
II, III, and aVF with 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1
through V6 (these were dynamic changes).

At [**Hospital1 69**], she had a normal
sinus rhythm with a prolonged P-R interval with normal axis.
Status post catheterization with a left axis deviation, still
with 0.5-mm ST elevations inferiorly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2178-7-2**], the patient was on
aspirin, Lipitor, morphine, heparin, Integrilin, and
nitroglycerin drip.

She was asymptomatic with no nausea, chest pain, chest
pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema.  Her
lung examination was markedly improved on her second hospital
day with crackles halfway up.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**7-2**] which showed an
ejection fraction of 50%.  No aortic stenosis.  Mitral
regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.  No
effusions.  The left atrium was mildly dilated with inferior
wall motion abnormalities.

A chest x-ray from early on [**7-3**] showed likely congestive
heart failure with a tortuous aorta, small pleural effusions
(left greater than right), with pulmonary edema.

There was a discussion on [**7-2**] regarding taking the
patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory for treatment
of her left-sided disease.  However, it was decided that at
this time the culprit lesion was indeed the right coronary
artery, and the left-sided lesions would possibly be
corrected at a later date.

On [**7-3**], the patient was placed on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
twice per day and given some as needed medications for her
gas/bloating.  She did have two brief hypotensive episodes to
a systolic blood pressure of 90 which quickly corrected with
250-cc boluses times two.  Her creatine kinases trended down
nicely from 3092 to 2199 to 1456.  Her MB fractions also
trended down from 401 to 221 to 110.

On [**2178-7-4**], the patient was changed from atorvastatin
to fluvastatin because of a recent study indicating a
mortality benefit from fluvastatin as opposed to atorvastatin
when combined with Plavix.

On [**7-4**], the patient was also started on lisinopril 5 mg
p.o. every day and changed to Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. once per
day.  A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained which
showed the patient fully able to ambulate without becoming
symptomatic.  Her Foley catheter was discontinued.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in good
condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was informed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] (a
cardiologist in [**Location (un) 47**]) within the next week (telephone
number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6256**]).
2.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 16071**] answering service was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding our
plans for followup with him at [**Hospital6 3872**]
within the week.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   She was sent home with the support
of her daughter ([**Name (NI) 501**] [**Name (NI) **]) and given handouts on her
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute ST elevation inferoposterior
myocardial infarction. Congestive heart failure, systolic and
diastolic acute on chronic.  Coronary artery disease.
Hypertension.  Hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day.
2.  Clopidogrel bisulfate 75-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once
per day.
3.  Lansoprazole 30-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day.
4.  Lisinopril 5-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day.
5.  Simethicone 80-mg tablet half to one tablet p.o. four
times per day as needed (for gas).
6.  Metoprolol-XL 25 mg p.o. every day (do not crush).
7.  Fluvastatin 80-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day (do
not crush).

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Transfer from an outside hospital for
chest pain/pressure presumed to be acute myocardial
infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease, status post acute
myocardial infarction the week prior to admission.  The
patient was taken to the cath laboratory the week prior and
found to have three vessel disease with a significant right
coronary artery stenosis of 90%.  She received a thrombectomy
and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with a
[**Age over 90 **] in the distal right coronary artery.  The other
significant disease was a 30% left main coronary artery and a
70% proximal left anterior descending, as well as left
circumflex 99% lesion were not intervened upon at that time.
On her last hospital admission, she was found by
echocardiogram to have an ejection fraction of 50% with 2+
mitral regurgitation and inferolateral akinesis.

On the day of admission, [**2178-7-6**], the patient presented
to an outside hospital Emergency Room complaining of
""abdominal tightness"" and  pain between the shoulder blades,
similar to the symptoms that brought her to the [**Hospital1 **] hospital the week prior.  An electrocardiogram
showed ST elevations in the posterolateral leads.  Integrilin
was started and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for emergency percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty.

Catheterization findings: Hemodynamics:  Initial normal-low
PA pressure, intermittent marked elevation with reflected V
wave.  At conclusion of case, PA pressure was 22/12.

98 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals.  ST
depressions in leads V2 through V4.  Catheterization report:
See history of present illness.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit and placed on aspirin, Plavix,
fluvastatin, Integrilin.  The patient was switched from
Toprol XL to Lopressor b.i.d.  Her ACE was held given the
large dye load.  Patient was placed on telemetry.  A chest
x-ray was obtained and the patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells due to a hematocrit of 26%.  [**2178-7-7**], the patient's Metoprolol was changed to 25 q.a.m., 12.5
q.p.m.  Lisinopril was started at 5 mg after creatinine came
back at 1.1.  The patient was asymptomatic, but did complain
of occasional dyspepsia.  The hematocrit after one unit of
packed red blood cells was at 26.9.  The patient was
transfused an additional two units of packed red blood cells
which brought her hematocrit to 34.3.  A chest x-ray was
obtained the previous day which showed a small bilateral
pleural effusions.

An echocardiogram was obtained which showed:
1.  The left ventricular cavity size as normal.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess, but is
probably normal (left ventricular ejection fraction greater
than 55%).
2.  There is a pericardial effusion.  The valves were not
well visualized.

with two vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was normal.  The
LAD had a focal calcified 60-70% lesion in the midportion.
The circumflex total occlusion of the proximal segment with a
robust left-to-left and right-to-left collaterals filling a
large single OM.  The RCA was a dominant vessel with a widely
patent [**Hospital1 **].

Hemodynamics showed normal right and left heart filling
pressures at rest during PCI with associated hypertension,
anxiety, the PA tracing showed new large V waves with PA
systolic pressure rising to 60 mmHg.

Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal circumflex to
distal OM1 was performed using five overlapping 2.5 mm stents
for a total [**Hospital1 **] length of approximately 80 mm.

Left femoral arteriotomy closure was performed using an 8F
Angioseal device.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for
monitoring.

CONTINUATION:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit after operation for fluid management.  In
brief, the patient's postoperative course was essentially
unremarkable.  A Swan catheter was in on postoperative day
one to gage her fluid status and measuring cardiac output.
She remained intubated until postoperative day number five
and she was aggressively hydrated postoperative day one for
low urine output and her blood pressure was controlled by
Nitroglycerin intravenous drip and she was started on beta
blocker, Lopressor 10 mg q6hours.  She is empirically started
on a five day course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl for
prophylactic treatment.  From postoperative day three, she is
started on some Lasix to help mobilize fluid and she
responded to the diuretic effectively.  She is essentially
negative for two liters every day from postoperative day
number three and, by postoperative day number five, she is
tolerating well mechanical ventilation.  She is successfully
extubated on that day.  After extubation, the patient
remained in the Intensive Care Unit for two more days.
During that time, she was agitated and self discontinued her
own central line and attempt was made to replace central
venous catheter which failed and she was successfully placed
with a small bore intravenous for peripheral fluids and
peripheral intravenous antibiotics.  She is then started on
regular diet for which she tolerated well with good ostomy
output.  She was transferred to the floor on [**2126-8-8**],
postoperative day number seven, and remained afebrile with
good blood pressure control.  She had a minimal amount of
pain and was on two liters of oxygen with nasal cannula.  She
receives aggressive pulmonary therapy and was ambulating with
assistance of physical therapy.   She is making a good amount
of urine every day and is discharged to rehabilitation
facility for further physical rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lisinopril 15 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Albuterol inhaler as needed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Sigmoid diverticulitis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 52306**] is a 67-year-old
lady who initially presented to her primary care physician
with fevers and left lower abdominal pain and distention in
early [**2126-6-4**].  Subsequent workup including a CT scan
showed sigmoid diverticulitis, thickening of the adjacent
sigmoid colon wall, and a large presacral abscess with a
right adnexal mass.

Subsequently, she was admitted to the hospital and treated
with IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Flagyl.  She has
also been started on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor for
her hypertension.  She tolerated that admission and was
discharged to home with levofloxacin and Flagyl.

She now returns to Dr.[**Name (NI) 4999**] service for surgical
management of her diverticulitis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Ovarian cyst.
3.  Diverticulitis.
4.  Pelvic mass.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 5 mg.
2.  Atenolol 75 mg b.i.d.
3.  Lisinopril 30 mg b.i.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2126-8-1**] for scheduled low-anterior resection of
the sigmoid colon and also resection of the pelvic mass.  She
underwent general anesthesia.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**] performed a sigmoid
colectomy and a diverting ileostomy and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] from the
Gynecology Service performed a resection of the pelvic mass.
She tolerated the procedure well.  Intraoperatively, there
were transient EKG changes and urine output was low which
required 10 liters of fluid during the operation.  She was
subsequently transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
for postoperative fluid management.

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77-year-old female with PMH of reported COPD (not confirmed by
prior PFTs), incisinal hernia following an ileostomy and
reversal, and treatment for an abdominal abscess, chronic
leukocytosis, chronic abnormal chest CT with mild bronchiectasis
and some right middle lobe opacities, presents with gradually
worsening shortness of breath over the past 3-5 months, worse on
exertion, and instructed by her PCP to present to the ED today.
Over the past few days she has become increasingly dyspneic
simply walking around her house.  She has been taking combivent
qid and 2 puffs flovent [**Hospital1 **].  She has a chronic dry cough,
productive of small amounts of yellow or white sputum, and this
cough has not got worse of late.  No fevers, chills, weight
loss, night sweats, chest pain, palpitations, flu-like symptoms,
hemoptysis, abdominal pain, sick contacts.  Acknowledges
occasional wheeze.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.0 69 132/67 20 94% 3L She was
given duonebs, solumedrol 125 and started on levofloxacin for
possible COPD exacerbation.  Although her breathing became
easier, she continued to be tachypneic with RR>30, and she was
transferred to the ICU for this reason.  Vitals prior to
transfer were: 97.5 72 124/99 27 94% 3L

On arrival in the MICU, she is in no acute distress. Reports
that dyspnea has improved considerably since time of
presentation.  RR was down to <20 by time of arrival to floor.
Vitals were: 78, 121/61, 76, 23, 89% 3L.  On moving to use the
commode, her oxygen saturaton dropped to 89% and RR went up to
32, and oxygen was increased to 6L NS.  She continues to
intermittently desaturate to the high 80s with minimal exertion,
but remains asymptomatic with these desaturations.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with multiple comorbidities, presents with gradually
worsening SOB and dyspnea on exertion, without evidence of
infection; treated for likely COPD exacerbation.

Active Issues:
=====================================
# COPD exacerbation:  Restrictive PFTs documented in [**2127**], but
reported history of COPD.  Patient presented with gradually
worsening respiratory function over several months. She denied
fevers, chills, sick contacts, URI [**Name2 (NI) 34370**], productive cough in
addition to CXR without infiltrate made pneumonia an unlikely
diagnosis. No tachycardia, EKG changes or other clinical
findings to suspect PE.  No EKG changes, chest pain to suggest
cardiac etiology. Initially in the ICU the patient was started
on azithromycin and converted to a prednisone 60mg x 10 day
taper. Her course was longer given her poor air movement on
exam. Her respiratory status was stable on 2-3L supplemental O2
and she was called out to the floor on HD#1. Pt did well on
prednisone taper and albuterol nebs, and completed 5 day course
of azithromycin on medicine floor on [**2135-9-26**]. Although she
reported improvement, she still desaturated while ambulating on
room air, and thus qualified for home O2 therapy. As pt derived
benefit from neb treatments, nebulizer machine/unit was
prescribed at discharge. Pt was discharged with VNA services,
home PT, and O2 2L NC after cleared by physical therapy. Blood
cultures were no growth to date at time of discharge.  She was
instructed to follow up with her PCP for consideration of
outpatient pulmonary referral should her symptoms not resolve in
another week. She last saw a pulmonologist in [**2127**].

Chronic Issues:
======================================
# Hypertension: Patient was continued on her home clonidine
patch, amlodipine, metoprolol, valsartan. SBP at discharge 130s.

# DM: Patient was on ISS during hospital course and continued on
her home metformin at time of discharge.

# HLD: Patient was continued on her home Crestor.

# Allergic rhinitis: Continued home fexofenadine prn.

# GERD: Continued omeprazole during hospitalization. Recommend
taper off omeprazole and switch to H2 blocker.

Transitional Issues:
====================================
-Pt has followup with PCP in one week: [**2135-10-3**]
-Have recommended she speak with PCP and seek repeat outpatient
PFTs and re-establish care with pulmonologist.
-Pt has oustanding micro date: f/u blood cultures (as of [**9-26**]
No growth to date).
-Pt is complete following taper:
Prednisone 30mg once a day on [**9-27**]
Prednisone 20mg once a day on [**2133-9-27**]
Prednisone 10mg once a day on [**11-11**]
**Last day of this medication will be on [**2135-10-1**].
Tapered dose - DOWN
-Pt will benefit from home PT for deconditioning and home O2
therapy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname 52306**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at [**Hospital1 771**].

You came into the hospital because you were having difficulty
breathing and walking up steps. We think this was due to a
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (aka COPD). This is a
chronic breathing problem related to smoking. We are treating
you with azithromycin for 5 days and treating you currently with
prednisone for 10 days. Your primary care physician will decide
if you should see a lung doctor called a pulmonologist or if you
should have further testing performed.

The following changes were made to your medications:
-Take prednisone as follows:
Prednisone 30mg once a day on [**9-27**]
Prednisone 20mg once a day on [**2133-9-27**]
Prednisone 10mg once a day on [**11-11**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old man
with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis status post TIPS
procedure one month prior to admission who was found down at
home.

The patient had some confusion the night before and had been
intubated in the field for airway protection.  The patient
was brought to the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room on [**3-24**] and found to have an ammonia level
of 115.

Head CT done in the Emergency Room was negative, and the
patient had a questionable retrocardiac opacity on chest
x-ray.

The patient was placed on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for presumed
aspiration while in the Emergency Room and discharged on
[**2130-4-2**].

The patient's EFP that was checked during that time was 4.4.
The patient was then taken to the MICU where he was extubated
and had an NG tube placed.

After the patient was stabilized and extubated in the MICU,
the patient was transferred to the Medicine Floor.  The
patient was started on p.o. Lactulose for his hepatic
encephalopathy.  His oxygen saturations remained normal.

On [**3-26**], the patient had pulled out his NG tube; however,

at [**Hospital6 256**].  The patient has no
history of intravenous drug use.  No history of smoking
currently.  The patient does have a home health aide that
comes in once a day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission in the
Emergency Room temperature was 97.8??????, blood pressure 135/56,
pulse 82.  General:  He was intubated initially at the time
on assist control, 650 x 16, PEEP of 5, FIO2 40% before he
was weaned off on day #2 of hospital stay in the MICU.
General:  The patient was unresponsive initially with
numerous angiomas on his chest and jaundice appearing.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Sclera
were icteric.  Neck:  Supple.  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Abdomen:  Soft, showed no masses.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
Liver was palpable two fingerbreadths below the right costal
margin.  Spleen tip was noted on exam.  Rectal:  Guaiac
positive.  Extremities:  There were 2+ distal pulses
bilaterally.  No lower extremity edema.  Neurological:  He
moved all of his extremities and withdrew to pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 8.9,
hematocrit 42, platelet count 94; INR 1.6, PT 15.5; CHEM7
showed a sodium 138, 4.6, chloride 106, bicarb 25, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 151; LFT showed an ALT of 47, AST
103, LD 277, alkaline phosphatase 198, total bilirubin 10.5,
ammonia level 115; urinalysis was significant for a specific
gravity of 1.020, urobilinogen of 12, pH 7.0; serum and urine
toxicology screens were both negative; blood cultures were
negative.

Chest x-ray on admission showed a questionable retrocardiac
opacity and an NG tube that was in place.  Cervical spine
film on admission showed no fracture.  Head CT was negative
on admission.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm,
.................., normal axis, flat T in lead III, T-wave
inversion in R.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Altered mental status:  Given the
history of cirrhosis and the recent TIPS procedure, as well
as increased bilirubin and ammonia levels, there was initial
concern for hepatic etiology.  This was later confirmed after
Urology consult was asked to evaluated the patient.  They
determined that the patient also most likely hepatic
encephalopathy secondary to his alcoholic cirrhosis.

Given the patient's hepatic encephalopathy, p.o. Lactulose
was given to the patient until he later developed an ileus at
which point the patient was given p.r. Lactulose enemas.

The patient also received an abdominal ultrasound which
showed no ascitic fluid and a questionable hepatic lesion
that was later confirmed on abdominal CT.  This had not been
seen on a prior abdominal CT done less than two months prior
to admission.

For his hepatic encephalopathy, the Liver Service was
consulted, and they recommended an MRI of the liver to be
done as an outpatient.  The patient's hepatic encephalopathy
slowly cleared, and his LFTs, and his ammonia levels
gradually trended down.

On the date of discharge, the patient's ammonia levels had
decreased to 70, and the patient no longer had asterixis on
exam.  On the day of discharge as well, the patient was alert
and oriented times three and was conversing and able to
follow questions and conservations and was both lower
extremities to converse with the Russian translator and the
Medical Team.

The patient was also continued on his Propanolol for his
varices given his history of alcoholic cirrhosis.

2.  Questionable pneumonia:  The patient was thought to have
a pneumonia upon admission given that there was a
retrocardiac opacity seen on the initial chest x-ray.

A repeat chest x-ray was done which did not show this
retrocardiac opacity, and the patient was stopped on
Levofloxacin for his presumed pneumonia.

The patient continued to have good oxygen saturations
throughout the hospital course and did not develop any upper
respiratory infection symptoms or any symptoms of pneumonia
such as cough, fever, or chills.

3.  Ileus versus obstruction:  The patient was determined to
have an ileus on day #3 of his hospital stay when his abdomen
became extremely distended.  Abdominal x-ray and an abdominal
CT confirmed the diagnosis of a severe ileus.  A colonic or
small bowel obstruction was not determined to be the cause of
the patient's abdominal distention.

Surgery and Liver Services were both consulted for the
patient's ileus.  Both recommended NG tube placement and
conservative management.  The patient had an NG tube placed
and was kept NPO until his ileus gradually resolved over the
course of his hospital stay.

The patient was also given daily Lactulose enemas to improve
his ileus and at one point also received a gastrografin enema
at the suggestion of the Surgery Service to alleviate his
symptoms.

The patient had serial abdominal exams and abdominal x-rays
done to determine that the patient's ileus was slowly
improving.

The patient pulled out his NG tube three days prior to
discharge without any complications.  By that time, the
patient was tolerating clear liquids without any nausea or
vomiting or other complications.

The patient was then advanced to full liquids and tolerated
this well and then to soft solids and tolerated this diet
well without any further nausea or vomiting or complications.

The patient was placed on TPN for four days during his
hospital stay until he was able to tolerate a full liquid
diet.

At the time of discharge, the patient still had an ileus,
although this was resolving as evidenced by serial abdominal
x-rays daily and serial clinical abdominal exams.

3.  Alcoholic cirrhosis:  The patient was placed on
Propanolol for his varices secondary to his alcoholic
cirrhosis.  The patient was also followed by the Liver
Service who recommended outpatient MRI of the liver upon
discharge.

4.  Diabetes:  The patient had his Glyburide held during his
hospital stay and was placed on an Insulin sliding scale and
had his fingersticks checked four times a day.  The patient's
fingersticks remained within normal limits throughout his
hospital stay.

5.  Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has a history of
thrombocytopenia secondary to hypersplenism and has
cirrhosis.  The patient was initially started on subcue
Heparin, but then this was discontinued secondary to his
thrombocytopenia.  The patient's thrombocytopenia did not
change over the course of his hospitalization and remained
stable upon discharge.

6.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was placed on a protime pump
inhibitor, given Venodynes, and the patient also had Physical
Therapy work with him once he was more stable on the Medical
Floor.

7.  FEN:  The patient was NPO initially and given intravenous
fluids until he could gradually tolerate clear liquids and
PPN.

At the time of discharge, the patient was already tolerating
a soft, solid diet.  The patient also had his electrolytes
repleted aggressively daily.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To a rehabilitation facility.

FOLLOW-UP:  Primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1-2 weeks after
discharge.  The patient was also advised to get an outpatient
MRI of his liver done at some point to further evaluate his
hepatic lesion as recommended by the Liver Service here at
[**Hospital6 256**].  The patient was also
discharged with instructions to stop drinking and to
follow-up with any alcoholic rehabilitation program if
necessary.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic ileus.
2.  Hepatic encephalopathy.
3.  Alcohol cirrhosis.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Status post variceal bleed.
6.  Thrombocytopenia.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73yo M with CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**2132-2-6**] as well as DM, HTN
and ESLD with cirrhosis complicated by esophageal varices,
encephalopathy and thrombocytopenia who presents with shortness
of breath and found to have elevated cardiac enzymes.
.
1.  CV:
A.  NSTEMI/CAD: Given his history of CAD s/p NSTEMI recently,
his shortness of breath in combination with positive cardiac
enzymes and ECG are consistent with another episode of ACS.
However as he is DNR/DNI and has significant liver disease
complicated by history of esophageal varices and
thrombocytopenia he was considered high risk for further
intervention (cardiac catheterization or thrombolytics).  After
discussion with cardiology service who saw the pt on the floor,
the pt was transferred to the CCU for medical management of his
ACS. Patient was monitored on telemetry and followed with serial
ECGs. No heparin gtt, GPIIb/IIIa or Plavix at this time given
his coagulopathy and bleeding risk. Patient was also not taken
for cardiac catheterization given his bleeding risk and overall
poor functional status. He was continued on ASA 325 mg once
daily. Patient was initially on metoprolol but this was briefly
switched to sotalol in the setting multiple runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He was switched back to a
low dose of metoprolol on discharge. No statin was initiated
given his known underlying liver disease.
.
B.  CHF: The pt has intact biventricular function as per last
TTE, however has clinical evidence of volume overload which may
be due to RHF/LHF or due to ESLD. The patient received Lasix IV
in the ED with good diuresis and was then slightly hypotensive.
Additional diuretics were held initially and then were restarted
as his blood pressure tolerated. His volume status was monitored
and he was restarted on his home dose of spironolactone.
Furosemide was also restarted on day of discharge.  His volume
status should continue to be followed at rehab.
.
C.  Rhythm: Had multiple runs of VT [**Date range (1) 54651**]. Initially given
lidocaine 50 mg x 2, with little effect, then sotalol 40 mg,
with good response. Sotalol was discontinued on [**6-13**] (last dose
on am of [**6-12**]) with no further episodes of ventricular
tachycardia. He was restarted on his usual low dose beta
blocker.

.
d.   Valves: No murmurs on exam. Pt previously had an TTE in
[**2132-3-3**].  ECHO was not repeated during this [**Date Range **] as was
unlikely to change clinical management.
.
2.  Altered MS: The differential for this is broad, but includes
ACS, hepatic encephalopathy, possibly secondary to acute
decompensation of liver disease (Portal vein thrombosis, tips
failures, etc), med/toxin (given Ativan in ED x 2).  Head CT was
negative for any acute bleed. Patient was initially very
agitated in the ED and received Ativan.  He was then
intermittently agitated and confused during his stay; he was
oriented to self only. By report patient is confused at baseline
and had some non-compliance with lactulose at rehab, so this was
most likely hepatic encephalopathy in setting of ESLD. Lactulose
PO/PR was titrated to [**3-8**] BM/day and he was also started on
rifaximin.  Could consider RUQ US with dopplers to assess portal
veins and tips after ACS is resolved.
.
3.  ESLD: Etiology EtOH/HCV, with clinical history consistent
with decompensated liver disease including ascites, varices and
encephalopathy. Continued on beta blocker for portal HTN and
secondary ppx of varices. Continued on Protonix. Diuretics
initially held.  Spironolactone and furosemide restarted prior
to discharge. Patient continued on lactulose and started on
rifaximin for treatment of his hepatic encephalopathy.
.
4.  DM: Oral hypoglycemics were held and patient was started on
an insulin sliding scale.  He will be discharged on his usual
dose of oral hypoglycemics along with the sliding scale for
additional coverage.
.
5. Abnormal Chest X-ray: Patient with evidence of volume
overload on [**6-10**], repeat chest x-ray on [**6-13**] suspicious for
pneumonia, however, patient without any clinical evidence of
pneumonia: afebrile, no cough, increasing O2 requirement, or
increasing WBC. Decision was made refrain from treatment with
antibiotics and to follow clinically. If patient should have
increased O2 requirement, cough, fever, would recommend repeat
CXR and consideration of a course of antibiotics.
.
5.  EtOH abuse: No signs/symptoms of withdrawal while
hospitalized.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 69-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, previous stroke, who was transferred from
[**Country 26231**] on [**2125-4-3**] for management of a left-sided MCA stroke
status post hemorrhagic conversion.

The patient lives in [**Country 26231**] with her family, however, she
receives her primary medical care from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] at the
[**Hospital6 1708**].  Therefore after the
significant stroke that she suffered in [**Country 26231**], the plan was
to transfer to the [**Hospital1 756**].  However, there were no ICU beds
available at [**Hospital6 1708**], and therefore the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.

The patient initially presented to a hospital in [**Country 26231**] in
[**2125-3-29**] after the sudden onset of right-sided hemiplegia at
home.  The patient was sent immediately to the hospital and
at the hospital was noted to be in new onset atrial
fibrillation.  A CAT scan of the head at the time apparently
showed an ischemic stroke in the left MCA territory with mass
effect.  The patient was admitted to the MICU in [**Country 26231**].

Evaluation by Neurology at the outside hospital revealed that
the stroke was likely cardioembolic in origin, and the
patient was started on low molecular weight Heparin.  For
mental status changes including respiratory distress, the
patient had a repeat CT of the head on [**2125-4-2**] at the
hospital in [**Country 26231**] that revealed hemorrhagic transformation
of the stroke with major mass effect and shift.  The patient
was treated with decadron and mannitol.  The patient
subsequently became more stuporous, and with difficulty
controlling her oral secretions, she was subsequently
intubated.

The following day, the patient developed severe hypotension
and for treatment of this, was intravascularly volume
resuscitated and started on pressors and sedated.  At the
hospital in [**Country 26231**], the patient also developed severe
elevation of her liver transaminases and INR concerning for
shock liver.  It was at this point that the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

On arrival, the patient was sedated and intubated.  She had
received an unclear amount of mannitol and decadron for the
mass effect related to the stroke.  She was no longer on
Heparin.  She was accompanied by many family members
including her husband, son, and two daughters.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hyperthyroidism status post thyroidectomy.
3. Previous stroke of the left occipital region thought to be
related to toxoplasmosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is an unfortunate 60-year-old
female with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension,
and hyperthyroidism, who is transferred from [**Country 26231**] for
further management of a very large left-sided MCA stroke with
hemorrhagic transformation in the setting of anticoagulation
for a presumed cardioembolic etiology of the stroke.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Neurology:  As stated above, the patient had a very large
left MCA stroke with hemorrhagic conversion.  Initial
evaluation included a repeat CAT scan and MRI of the
patient's brain to assess the severity of the mass effect and
shift, and to assess for acute worsening.

Upon comparison of the CT of the head from the [**Hospital 26231**]
hospital on [**4-2**] versus a CT of the head on admission, there
was no change in the mass effect or edema seen.  The CT at
[**Hospital3 **] was read as a large area of low density within
the left frontal lobe, insular, and basal ganglia region with
some extension towards the medial aspect of the left frontal
lobe.  There was also noted to be compression of the left
lateral ventricle.  There was also noted to be areas of
varying hyperdensities seen within the low density region.
The radiologist commented that these likely represented areas
of hemorrhagic transformation of an initially ischemic
infarct, however, the less dense areas raise the possibility
of neoplasm.

The Neurology Stroke team was consulted immediately upon
patient's arrival.  Upon their review of the CT of the head,
they recommended a MRI for further definition of the area as
there was some concern that the finding on CT scan may not be
a simple stroke, but could represent some type of neoplasm.

MRI and MRA was performed on the day of admission.  The
impression was that there was an abnormal signal intensity in
the left frontal lobe, lentiform nucleus and sylvian fissure
involving [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with moderate increased
signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images and gyriform
hemorrhage most consistent with a history of a five-day old
hemorrhagic infarct.  They also noted a small hematoma in the
basal ganglia.  The infarct was said to involve portions of
the left MCA and ACA territory, possible ACA territory
involvement is related to mass effect.  Also noted on the
MRI/MRA was considerable left-sided mass effect, unchanged
from the CT.  An old left occipital infarct and opacification
of mastoid air cells.  MRA specifically showed markedly
diminished flow in both left MCA divisions compared to the
right supporting the diagnosis of a left cerebral infarct.
MRA of the neck showed no evidence of significant stenosis
and left carotid bifurcation and also showed no antegrade
flow in the cervical portions in the left vertebral artery.

Based on the MRI/MRA results, it was feeling of both the
Neurology, Neurosurgery, and MICU teams that the patient's
condition was secondary to an ischemic event and not to a
primary neoplasm.  Based on the recommendations from the
Neurosurgery service, who were also initially consulted upon
patient's arrival, the patient was started on IV decadron.
It was decided not to use mannitol as the patient's serum
osmolality was in the 300s, and therefore the patient would
be at risk for further brain edema with mannitol use.  The
goal blood pressure was to be 140-160 systolic and the
patient required IV Nipride to keep her blood pressure within
a desired range.  The patient was continued on
assist-control ventilatory support during initial admission.

Also per the Neurosurgical team, the patient was given FFP
and platelets to keep her INR 1.3 or less, and to keep her
platelets greater than 50,000.  This is to prevent further
hemorrhagic transformation of her stroke.  During the time
between admission and [**2125-4-20**], the date of this dictation,
the patient showed no improvement or change in her
neurological status.  She was kept free of any sedating or
mind altering medications, and still had no improvement in
her awareness or neurological examination.  She continued to
exert signs of any brain stem function and no higher
functioning.  She did not have any purposeful movements of
the extremities, withdrew to pain only in the lower
extremities, and was nonresponsive to verbal stimuli.

2. Hematology:  The patient was in DIC by laboratory data on
admission including a very high SBP and D dimer as well as
low platelets and peripheral smear findings of schistocytes.
It was felt that the DIC was secondary to either her stroke
or to her ventilator-associated pneumonia that was discovered
on admission.

The patient was given FFP to keep her INR 1.3 or less.  She
required FFP until [**4-12**] at which time by laboratory
data, she showed resolution of DIC.  Patient was also
administered platelets on a daily basis until [**2125-4-11**].  Her
platelets then stabilized on the [**4-12**] as well.  The
patient's hematocrit drifted down initially presumed
secondary to hemolysis, and the patient required packed red
blood cell transfusion to keep her hematocrit in the 28 to 30
range.  It was presumed that the patient had CAD with her
multiple risk factors, and therefore, her goal hematocrit was
between 28 and 30.  The patient was no longer showing signs
of hemolysis by [**4-12**], and iron studies were sent that
were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

3. Infectious disease:  On chest x-ray on admission, the
patient had a retrocardiac infiltrate.  It was presumed that
this was likely aspiration in the setting of intubation
versus a ventilator-associated pneumonia.  As the patient had
been intubated for approximately five days prior to transfer,
it was decided to cover her broadly for a
ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Therefore, the patient was
treated with an empiric course of Zosyn for 14 days total for
the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Due to fever and a leukocytosis with a white blood cell count
increase to 20,000 with a leftward shift, the patient had
multiple blood cultures sent.  On [**2125-4-9**], the patient's
right IJ that was placed at the outside hospital was removed,
and the tip was sent for culture in the setting of fever.  A
left subclavian was placed on [**4-9**] without complication.
Blood cultures from the previously sited right IJ grew out
Enterobacter cloacae 1/4 bottles that was sensitive to
Levaquin and ciprofloxacin, and was resistant to ceftazidime
and ceftriaxone.  It was also resistant to Zosyn.  Therefore,
it was decided to initiate the patient on a two-week course
of IV ciprofloxacin to treat this bacteremia.

As the patient continued to improve with only low-grade
temperatures and a drop in her white count to normal range,
it was decided not to double cover this gram-negative
organism.  The patient also had coag-negative Staph grow out
from two sets of blood cultures, one from the site where the
A line was placed.  Therefore, the A line was D/C'd on
[**2125-4-12**].  The patient was transiently treated with
vancomycin, however, this was discontinued as no subsequently
blood cultures grew out coag-negative Staph, and the patient
improved clinically.

4. Endocrine:  The patient required an insulin drip for
adequate control of her glucose, i.e., for goal blood sugars
between 80-120 while on IV decadron and with her infection.
This was continued through [**2125-4-18**].  The patient was
subsequently started on NPH and a regular insulin-sliding
scale.  The patient was also continued on her Synthroid
through the nasogastric tube.  The patient's Synthroid was
the same as her home dose.  The home dose of Synthroid is as
follows:  She was given Synthroid 75 mcg on Saturday and
Sunday, and Synthroid 125 mcg Monday through Friday.

5. Nutrition:  A nasogastric tube was placed on the patient's
day of admission, and she was administered tube feeds.  She
had no difficulty tolerating the tube feeds and remained at
goal through her hospital stay.  With the patient's fevers
between [**4-12**] and [**2125-4-13**], it was decided to place an OG
tube and D/C the nasogastric tube for concern of sinusitis.
She tolerated this well and was continued on her tube feeds.

The Interventional Pulmonary service was [**Name (NI) 653**], and asked
to place a PEG, which was planned for [**2125-4-20**] the day of
this dictation.  At the same time, a tracheostomy was also to
be performed.  The patient required daily repletion of
potassium and magnesium and intermittent repletion of
calcium.

6. The patient's cardiovascular issues included labile
hypertension as well as atrial fibrillation.  For the
patient's atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation was obviously
not a possibility with the large hemorrhagic stroke.  Rate
control was achieved with amiodarone initially.  However, as
the amiodarone failed to convert the patient and as she
initially had very high LFTs, felt presumed to be secondary
to shock liver, the amiodarone was discontinued.  The patient
was therefore rate controlled with IV Lopressor.

For the patient's labile blood pressure, she initially
required hydralazine IV prn, nitroprusside, and labetalol
drips.  However, after one week of hospitalization, the drips
were weaned, and the patient had adequate blood pressure
control with IV Lopressor at 5 IV q.4-6h. standing.

Also under cardiovascular, the patient had a significant
amount of upper extremity edema and hand edema secondary to
both volume repletion and FFP and packed red cell
transfusions.  She was roughly 20 liters positive after three
weeks in the hospital.  Therefore, she was diuresed for this
reason and responded to 20-40 of IV Lasix.  She had normal LV
function on transthoracic echocardiogram done in [**Country 26231**]
prior to transfer.  The echocardiogram also showed LVH and
diastolic dysfunction.

7. GI:  As stated above, the patient had shock liver upon
presentation that resolved, so that her LFTs were within
normal range by [**2125-4-20**].  She was continued on tube feeds
with planned PEG for [**2125-4-20**].

8. Respiratory:  The patient was initially placed on assist
control.  She was then converted to mandatory minute
ventilation.  However, as the patient continued to have
significant apnea, she was transferred back to assist
control.  By [**2125-4-20**], the patient had less apnea and was
tolerating some trials of pressure support.  The plan was for
tracheostomy on [**2125-4-20**].

9. Code:  After many family discussions with the primary ICU
team, the Stroke team, priest on staff, and Social Work and
Nursing, it was decided that the patient would be DNR by the
patient's family.  They family was very aware and
knowledgeable of the patient's poor prognosis and
neurological condition.  They were informed by the
aforementioned teams that the patient would likely have
little to no neurologic recovery and at best, she would have
a right-sided hemiplegia and would likely be unable to
communicate, and would require 24-hour nursing level care.
The family understood this and decided that they still wished
everything medically possible be done for the patient.  They
also requested the tracheostomy and PEG, and they desired
that the patient be placed in a rehabilitation center or a
nursing home in the United States.

At the time of this dictation, [**2125-4-20**], this was still under
planning.

10. Disposition:  As stated above, the planned disposition
for the patient was a rehabilitation facility.  As of
[**2125-4-20**], this was still being worked out.  The remainder of
this dictation will be completed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

ADDENDUM:  This is an Addendum to the Discharge Summary that
was done on [**2125-4-3**] to [**2125-4-20**].  This addendum
addresses hospital events from [**2125-4-20**] to [**2125-4-27**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):

1.  NEUROLOGIC/LEFT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY INFARCTION ISSUES:
The patient was initially put on a ACE inhibitor.  For atrial
fibrillation, she was put on a beta blocker.  She was then given
a statin and baby aspirin for further stroke prevention.  In one
month, she should discontinue aspirin and be restarted on her
Coumadin for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation.

2.  HEMATOLOGY/DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION/ANEMIA
OF CHRONIC DISEASE ISSUES:  By the time the patient came to
the Neurology floor, she was no longer having any blood
transfusions.  Her hematocrit remained stable at 34.1, and
her platelets remained stable at 315.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL/SHOCKED LIVER ISSUES:  When the patient
arrived to the Neurology floor, her alanine-aminotransferase
was rechecked and found to be low at 68, and aspartate
aminotransferase checked and found to be normal at 48.  Her
alkaline phosphatase was 182 and total bilirubin was 0.9;
which was the lowest that her numbers have ever been during
this hospital course.

4.  CARDIOLOGY/ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  Given the
patient's atrial fibrillation, it was decided that an
echocardiogram should be performed.  The echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 40% with mild LVH and 2+
mitral regurgitation.  There was no evidence of a patent
foramen ovale or clot.  She was also ruled out for a
myocardial infarction a second time on the Neurology floor.

5.  PULMONARY EDEMA/PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  A chest x-ray was
repeated [**2125-4-25**] which showed resolving pulmonary edema, and no
evidence of pneumonia.  She was adequately treated with
antibiotics while on the Unit for her pneumonia.  She was
continued on Lasix for diuresis. While on the Neurology service,
she developed respiratory distress requiring transfer back to the
MICU on [**2125-4-27**]. CXR/ ABG pending at the time of this note.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/URINARY TRACT INFECTION WITH YEAST
ISSUES:  The patient had a fever of 101, so she was
pan-cultured.  Urinalysis showed 99 white cells, 0 epithelial
cells, and many yeast.  Infectious Disease was curbside, and
they recommended that the Foley catheter be changed.  They
also recommended that she be started on fluconazole 100 mg
per day for one week.  In addition to starting the
fluconazole, her peripherally inserted central catheter line
was removed and tip sent for culture.  Blood cultures and
sputum culture were also obtained. Repeat cultures performed
[**2125-4-27**] at time of transfer to MICU.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Left middle cerebral artery infarction.
 2.  Atrial fibrillation.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Diabetes.
 5.  Hypothyroidism.
 6.  Shocked liver.
 7.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
 8.  Anemia of chronic disease.
 9.  Pneumonia.
10.  Urinary tract infection.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
 1.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Prevacid 30 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Synthroid 125 mcg by mouth once per day (on Monday
through Friday) and 75 mcg by mouth once per day (on Saturday
and Sunday).
 4.  Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg by mouth q.4-6h. as needed.
 5.  Dulcolax 10 mg by mouth/per rectum as needed.

Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. Small
secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Moderately depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional left ventricular wall motion findings
as shown below; remaining LV segments contract normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data


REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. On manipulation
of the blood pressure, the MR was 3+ at a systolic pressure of
150 mmHg. There is a central jet with bileaflet retraction and a
globular shape of the LV cavity.
On bypass: The ASD by inspection shows multiple perforations of
the septum. On review of the clips, there are two distinct areas
of transseptal left-to-right flow in the membranous portion.

POST-BYPASS: Epi, phenylephrine, amiodarone infusion. There is a
well-seated annular ring of the mitral valve with no mitral
regurgitation seen. Biventricular systolic function is slightly
improved on inotropic support with LVEF 35%. Areas of wall
motion abnormalities are unchanged post-CPB.There is no ASD seen
by color Doppler and by Bubble Study. Aortic contours are normal
post-decannulation.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: pleural effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man s/p sternal debridement flap closure
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pleural effusion
INDICATION: Assess for pleural effusion.
COMPARISON: Comparison is made to study performed one hour
earlier.
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
Multiple plates and screws again seen overlying the mediastinum.
Right-sided PICC seen at least to the level of the distal SVC,
tip not well evaluated on this study. Other linear densities
overlying the chest possibly represent pacing wires. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours appear stable. Right sided atelectasis
again seen. No new focal consolidations seen within the lungs.
No evidence of pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pleural effusion. Otherwise, little
change from prior.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2142-1-15**] 6:21 PM
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST
Reason: evaluate for fluid collection
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with s/p CABG mv repair with sternal wound
infection
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for fluid collection
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT CHEST
REASON FOR EXAM: Evaluate for fluid collection. Patient post
CABG with sternal wound infection.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT through the chest following
administration of IV contrast. 5, 1.25-mm collimation images and
coronal reformations were reviewed.
FINDINGS: Retrosternal fluid collection located in the anterior
mediastinum at the level of the superior sternum body / aortic
arc, measures 53 x 39 mm with high density (37 Hounsfield
units). It is probably partially hemorrhagic. It continues
inferiorly with a small precardial collection. There is no
pericardial effusion. Cardiac size is slightly enlarged, patient
is post CABG. Wide dehiscense of the soft tissues anterior to
the sternum extends several cm, 3.5 cm below the xiphoid
process. It is not associated with fluid, though a small
fistulous connection to the prevascular space could be present
but not visible.
The sternum is apposed with no bone destruction to suggest
osteomyelitis.
The airways are patent to segmental level. There are few
subcentimeter paratracheal lymph nodes. The lungs are clear.
Left pleural effusion is small.
The upper abdomen showed no abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
Upper retrosternal fluid collection probably partially
hemorrhagic, free of definite connection to the wide soft tissue
dehiscence anterior to the sternotomy inferiorly, though a small
sinus tract is not excluded. No evidence of osteopmyelitis.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with sternal wound drainage on [**1-12**]. His
wound was opened and packed with normal saline wet to dry
dressing. Plastic surgery and infectious disease consults were
obtained. A CT of chest showed substernal fluid collection and
on [**1-17**] he was taken to the OR for sternal debridement and wire
removal. The chest was left open and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was chemically
paralyzed and sedated for 48 hours. He was then returned to OR
on [**1-19**] for sternal plating and pectoral flap closure by the
plastic surgery serrvice. Please see OR reports for details.
After closure pt returned to cardiac surgery ICU. His sedation
was weaned and he was extubated on POD1. He continued to
progress and was transferred to the step down floors on POD2.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to do well and on [**2142-1-24**] it was decided
the patient was stable and ready for discharge home with
visiting nurses and home infusion service. He will follow-up
with the plastic surgery service, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and his
cardiologist as an outpatient.

Trach placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58941**] is a 75 year old man with hx of BPH, HTN,
depression and high cholesterol who presented yesterday evening
to [**Hospital6 2561**] with ""inability to speak"".  The history
is very limited because the patient was unable to talk and no
one
accompanied him to the hospital to relay the history.  From
information gathered at [**Hospital3 **], the patient was feeling OK
today until sometime this evening after eating dinner.  Time
course and exact contents of the meal are not known, but he
apparently communicated (in writing) that the food was homemade
and leftovers.  He arrived at [**Hospital3 **] at 7:30-8:00PM.
 Vitals on arrival were: BP 154/86 HR77 RR21 98%on RA.  While
there, could only say one or two words at a time-other details
of
initial exam not documented in available paperwork.  He had a
head CT which was negative.  Around 11:50PM, he vomited and was
given Zofran.  At 1:00AM, he wrote ""please I need help, I think
I'm dying"".  He was reassessed and seen by neurology at some
point.  He repeatedly wrote ""I'm dying"" on paper. He was noted
to
have ""expressive aphasia"" and bilateral ptosis. There was
apparently concern for ""cortical stroke"" vs. toxin ingestion
such
as botulism.  He was then transfered here for further evaluation
and MRI.


Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. Depression
3. BPH
4. High cholesterol

Was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] in [**9-8**] for hyponatremia (?SIADH
from SSRIs) and failure to thrive. At that time he was noted to
have hx of weight loss in the past year of 20-25lbs

Chest CT [**2112-2-11**]:
FINDINGS: The endotracheal and gastric tubes are in satisfactory
position. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar,
or mediastinal lymph nodes. There is a 5-mm rounded density,
which is ill-defined, in the right upper lobe. There are
multiple other smaller ill-defined densities adjacent to this.
There are opacities in both lung apices, which could represent
pleural thickening or scarring. There is patchy air space
disease within the right lower lobe, with endobronchial spread.
There is also airspace disease of the right middle and left
lower lobes. There is calcification of the aortic arch and
descending aorta. The heart, pericardium and great vessels
otherwise are unrmarkable.
The stomach is full of ingested material.
Limited views of the upper abdomen show an unremarkable, liver,
gallbladder, spleen, and upper pole of the kidneys.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
Airspace disease within the left lower lobe, right lower lobe,
and right middle lobes, consistent with infection. Aspiration
cannot be excluded.

EMG [**2112-2-11**]
Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are
consistent with a neuromuscular transmission disorder, with
evidence for pre- synaptic dysfunction and widespread fiber
blocking, as seen in botulism.

The differential diagnosis includes other pre-synaptic
neuromuscular
transmission disorders (e.g., [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] myasthenic
syndrome); however, the rapidly progressive clinical picture and
pronounced ophthalmoplegia are atypical for this.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of his weakness.  He was
intubated in the ER for respiratory distress and transferred to
the ICU.  Subsequent blood testing revealed botulism toxin in
his blood.  Approximately 24 hours after admission the patient
received the anti-toxin from the CDC flown in from [**Location (un) 9012**],
[**State 3908**].  Over the course of this admission, the patient
developed a pneumonia that was treated with a 7 day course of
unasyn (although it is likely this pneumonia was more of a
chemical pneumonitis as he was given activated charcoal prior to
admission and may have aspirated).

He also suffered from gastroparesis requiring frequent enemas,
nutritional supplementation with TPN, and an aggressive bowel
regimen.  He was given several doses of neostigmine with the
hopes of improving bowel motility but he did not pass any
significant materail.  He can continue TPN indefinitely until
bowel has fully recovered per nutrition consult.  PICC line
placed on [**2112-2-20**] with tip in the distal SVC.

His ocular weakness has improved in that he is able to move his
eyes from side to side a bit, although still unable to open eyes
(bilateral ptosis).  He remains with good distal extremity
muscle strength in the arms and legs, but poor proximal muscle
strength, unable to lift any extremity off the bed.  He remains
on the ventilator with a trach collar.  He is now being
discharged to rehab, afebrile and in stable condition but
requiring continued aggressive PT.

Note:  He is completely awake and alert and can answer questions
using his hands.  He is unable to open his eyes due to weakness
of his eyelids.  This patient would benefit from speech therapy
and development of creative ways of communication (like pointing
to pictures when he wants to express something he wants, etc.)

He should undergo periodic trials of CPAP and pressure support
vent settings to see if he has regained his ability to breath
without the use of the vent.

He should also have aggressive PT/OT and range of motion
exercises.

Brief Hospital Course:
A: 75 year old man recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a
prolonged course of botulism, s/p tracheostomy who presented
with changes in mental status, right neck swelling, and RUQ
pain.

Change in mental status:  According to the family members and
nursing staff who took care of the patient on his prior
admission, his mental status was at base line or better when he
arrived in the MICU.  CT head on admission was normal.

Parotitis: Purulent discharge was expressed from [**Last Name (un) 58942**] duct
by the ENT consultant.  Cultures were taken of the discharge and
were pending at the time of discharge.  He was empirically
started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl.  During his
stay he remained afebrile and had a normal WBC count.  He
received IV hydration, warm compressed to right neck, and
massage.

RUQ pain:  The patient presented with mild RUQ pain and elevated
LFTs (ALT 151, AST 53, AP 790, [**Doctor First Name **] 103, TB 2.1).  RUQ U/S done
on [**2112-3-29**] showed sludge filling an otherwise
unremarkable-appearing gallbladder. A non-contrast abdominal CT
from [**2112-3-30**] showed a distended gall bladder without signs of
cholecystitis, a minimal amount of ascites, and an ill-defined
sclerotic lesions within the iliac bones bilaterally.  His
abdominal pain resolved during his hospital stay and his LFTs
were trending downward.  At the time of discharge his LFTs were
ALT 86, AST 36, LDH 167, AP 631, [**Doctor First Name **] 126, TB 1.0.  The patient's
abdominal exam and LFTs / [**Doctor First Name **] can be followed as an out patient.

_________________________________________
Radiology:

Chest AP [**2113-8-1**]-
The previously demonstrated tracheostomy has been dislodged in
the meantime interval. The upper trachea is slightly distorted
and tortuous. There is no overt pneumomediastinum.
The heart size is normal. Mediastinum has normal contours, width
and position. The right lower lobe consolidation is new. The
left lung is clear. The pleural surfaces are smooth with no
pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1) Slightly irregular upper trachea after tracheostomy
dislodgement.
2) New right lower lobe consolidations represent pneumonia or
aspiration.
CT chest without contrast [**2113-8-2**]-
A tracheostomy was inserted in the interval, with a 2-2.5 cm
intratracheal length. The trachea and the right main and right
lower lobe bronchus contain a large volume of secretions with
subsequent partial atelectasis of right lower lobe. Lower lobe
bronchiectasis is greater on the right in an area of
consolidation that is likely due to atelectasis, but pneumonia
cannot be excluded. Recurrent aspiration is likely given diffuse
distension of the esophagus with air and fluid.

Multiple centrilobular nodules in the upper lobes are bilateral,
more on the right, representing bronchiolitis, could be due to
aspiration or [**Doctor First Name **] infection.

Pleural effusions demonstrated on the neck CT from [**2112-3-8**]
have resolved. Diffuse calcification of the left apical pleura
most probably represents previous granulomatous infection.

Several mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, most diffusely
calcified, up to 1 cm in subcarinal region, 2A:56.
Atherosclerotic calcification involves all major coronary
arteries. The heart size is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. Pleural effusions demonstrated on the neck CT from
[**2112-3-8**] has been resolved.

Images of upper abdomen demonstrate percutaneous gastrostomy and
additional drainage for unknown purpose. The liver, the spleen,
the kidneys, the adrenals, and the pancreas are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Tracheostomy tube shorter than usually seen. No
complications.
2. Central airways secretions probably responsibe for right
lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Mild bibasilar bronchiectasis and upper lobe bronchiolitis
most probably due to recurrent aspiration, [**Doctor First Name **] infection cannot
be excluded.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, partially calcified, and
calcified pleural plaque with bilateral apical scarring could
represent previous granulomatous exposure.
5. Full length esophageal dilatation, suggest distal obstruction
or dysfunction.
Chest AP [**2113-8-4**]-CHEST: AP portable upright view. The
tracheostomy tube appears small, given the caliber of the
trachea. Previously noted opacities in the right upper, left
upper, and right lower lobes are slightly improved. There is no
pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. Heart and mediastinum
appear normal.

IMPRESSION: Partial improvement in multifocal consolidations.
Chest AP [**2113-8-10**]. Improving right lower lobe and right upper lobe
consolidation. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
normal.

IMPRESSION: Improving right upper lobe and right lower lobe
consolidation. Tracheostomy in good position.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year-old male with tracheostomy and prior MRSA in sputum,
status post tracheostomy change in ED following accidental
removal, with increased secretions/low-grade fever and
bronchiectasis on repeat CT.

1. Respiratory decompensation/hypoxemia
Pt was admitted and had copious thick secretions. CT scan showed
evidence of bibasilar bronchiectasis and upper lobe
bronchiolitis most probably due to recurrent aspiration. He was
treated with an empiric nine day course of vancomycin and
levaquin though CXR looked wholely good.  He also had moderate
improvement in secretions with atrovent PO (not through trach)
but a return of variable secretions (often thick) in upper and
lower airways since then. We continued pulmonary toilet, and
supplemental O2 via trach mask as needed. The possibility of
decannulation was entertained but in reviewing records from both
[**Hospital **] rehabilitation and in speaking with son, it was deemed
that it was not plausible; this had been attempted in the past
though was unsuccessful secondary to copious amounts of
secretions.

We also considered placing a cuffed trach in this pt to help
prevent aspiration of secretions. However, pt would have to go
to OR as stoma is small and this was decided against. Sputum
recultured from [**2113-8-6**] is growing GNR, unspeciated at this
point. On [**2113-8-10**] pt was started on cefepime, which he will
continue for a 10 day course. It is likely that pt has
bronchiectasis, is colonized, and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] intermittent
antibiotics at a scheduled dose.

2. Neuro: Pt with history of botulism as well as anoxic brain
injury from plugged trach. Neurology service here was consulted
and determined that based on their records, there were no new
changes. Mental status was variable, with 2 days of somnolence
and mildly unresponsive period, but other days of responsive and
attempting to communicate but still incoherent for us. Keppra
[**Hospital1 **] was continued.

3. HTN- continued metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] with good HR/BP control.

4. Anemia-Hct remained in the 33-37 range. Iron supplementation
was continued.

5. FEN: Tube feeds: Probalance full strength per nutrition recs.
 Electrolytes were checked and monitored.

Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per recturm with hemodynamic instability

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Right femoral line placement
2. EGD with vessel clipping

History of Present Illness:
30 y/o female with history of AML s/p allo BMT in [**12-7**] and
relapse detected in [**5-8**] now s/p MEC treatment ([**6-8**]) and DLI on
[**7-29**] and GVHD (leg pain, high LFT's) admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2106-8-17**]
for hematochezia.  She is now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BRBPR
and hemodynamic instability.
.
The current presentation started on Sunday, [**2106-8-15**], when the pt
recalls that she had 1 episode of painless, bright red bloody
emesis.  She says that the amount was small, less than 1 cup.
Monday, [**2106-8-16**], she had dark clotted blood with BM and less
yesterday [**2106-8-17**].  She was transferred from an OSH today for
further management.
.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she appeared comfortable to the admitting
resident and had no complaints (and specifically denied
abdominal pain).  At about 2:30 am today, she had a large,
marroon stool mixed with melena.  Her BP, which was 120s/70s on
arrival went to 90/60; her HR which was 70s on arrival went to
130s.  2 emergency-released units of prbcs were initiated.  She
was bolused 1000cc NS and an 80 mg pantoprazole bolus was
ordered.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], HR had decreased to the 90s but BP was
86/39.  She was mentating well and c/o rle pain and mild nausea.
 Pt denied current LH/dizziness, abd pain, CP, dyspnea/SOB.  2
events quickly ensued.
.
First, the blood bank called to let us know that the 2 units
running were JKB incompatible.  The transufusion was stopped,
the BMT fellow and blood bank resident on call were apprised and
2 units of cross-matched blood were rapidly procured.
.
Next, as the units ran in, the pt c/o LH and vomited
approximately 200c BRB. A femoral line was inserted and 3 units
were rapidly transfused.  The GI fellow, who had been called on
transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], arrived with the attending for emergent
EGD.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HX: She was first noticed to have leukocytosis and
thrombocytosis several years ago and a bone marrow bx at that
time revealed reactive marrow without dysplastic changes. At the

time of the birth of her daughter in [**12-6**] she was found to be
anemic and thrombocytopenic with immature circulating blasts and
a bone marrow showed 9% blast forms and cytogenetics showed an
8;21 translocation. She underwent 7+3 induction in [**1-7**] followed
by consolidation with HiDAC times three. She underwent an
alloSCT with cyto/TBI on [**2105-12-3**].  Her course was c/b mucositis,

neutropenic fever, and vaginal bleeding, resolved by the time of

her discharge.  She had a positive blood cultures thought due to

line infection with coag-neg. Staph in [**2-8**] and [**3-8**], and her
Hickman was d/c'd.  She had some acute stage I skin GVHD in [**4-7**]

that responded to low dose steroids.
.
Relapse detected in [**5-8**], confirmed with FISH. During admission
in [**2106-6-3**], patient received MEC therapy with good result;
repeat bone marrows have been without evidence of AML. She is
status post DLI on [**7-29**].

Brief Hospital Course:
# GI Bleed: The patient was initially admitted to BMT for
management of her GIB.  However, her Hct dropped from 27-20 over
a couple hours, and had a bloody bowel movement.  She  had
hemodynamic instability, with decreased BP to the 80's systolic
and HR >130.  She was transfused 3 units PRBCs.  The ICU team
was called, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for urgent EGD.
In the ICU, she had 200ml of hematemesis.  A protonix drip was
started.  A right femoral line was successfully placed for fluid
resusitation.  She was given NS and 2 additional units at that
time.  GI arrived and performed a EGD.  They found a bleeding
vessel but could not cauterize it.  They then successfully
clipped the vessel.  Post procedure, she was given 2 units of
FFP and 1 unit Platelets with a good response.  Her Hct was
followed q4.  Overnight, her Hct fell from 32 - 27.  She was
given 2 more units of PRBCs with an appropriate response.  On
[**8-19**], GI re-scoped her to re-assess the clips.  The clips were
shown to be intact. Over the course of her ICU stay she received
a total of 11 units of blood products. She was transferred back
to floor on [**2106-8-21**] and her henatocrit has been stable since.
.
# GVHD: The patient has known graft versus host disease of the
liver.  She was recently started on Cellcept [**Pager number **] TID. Also, she
is receiving Prednisone 50mg daily. Her bilitubin has been high
but slowly declining during her stay. She should continue on the
regimen above with the goal of decreasing her steroid dose.
.
# Bacteremia: Three bottles of blood cultures on two different
days were positive for coagulase negative staphylococci. The
patient's line was not pulled per attending (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], but
therapy with vancomycin through the line was initiated on
[**2106-8-19**]. Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 59575**] remained afebrile during the entire stay on
the floor. She will need continued IV antibiotic therapy for a
total of forteen days (last day [**2106-9-1**]).
.
# CMV Infection: Mrs [**Known lastname 59574**] was started on onduction therapy for
CMV infection. We switched her on oral Valganciclovir 900 [**Hospital1 **]
the day before discharge. During the induction period (21 days)
valganciclovir is taken twice daily and then reduced to once
daily. The patient's viral load decreased progressivly during
the course of her stay and was undetectable on they of
discharge.

MRI:
[**2106-9-17**]: L spine: Epidural mass extending from L3-4 to L5-S1
level with low T2 and isointense T1 signal could be due to an
epidural hematoma or due to leukemic infiltrates.
[**2106-9-18**]: L spine with contrast: The previously noted mass at the
anterior epidural space at L4 and L5 level does not demonstrate
enhancement. There is enhancement at the superior aspect which
appears to be secondary to venous enhancement. The mass appears
to be extending bilaterally into the neural foramina but no
enhancement is seen. There are no paraspinal abnormalities seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 30 year old woman with AML s/p allo with relapse, GVHD,
hematochezia p/w progressing gait impairment and sensory deficit

.
1.) Gait impairment: The patient's symptoms and exam were
concerning for cord compression from either an infectious or
neoplastic process in the L5 region.  High dose steroids were
started with dexamethasone 10 mg iv x1 and 4mg q6 hours
thereafter.  An emergent MRI was attempted.  A neurology consult
was obtained. However, due to patient pain and involuntary
movement despite mild sedation, initial imaging was inadequate.
The patient was electively intubated with general anesthesia to
allow for adequate imaging.  An epidural mass in the L4-L5
region was identified. A neurosurgical consult was obtained who
recommended CT guided biopsy. A CT guided biopsy was not
performed as it was thought that the lesion was not safely
approachable.  She was empirically treated for a chloroma with
radiation therapy.  She underwent XRT treatment planning to
receive 10 fractions treating to a total of 20 Gy.  She
tolerated the XRT well except for some mild nausea.  She
received  4 treatments while inpatient.  Her leg strength did
not appreciably improve during her hospital course.  She was
able to walk adequately with a walker.  She was evaluated by
physical therapy and was witnessed walking stairs safely prior
to discharge.  She will receive PT services as an outpatient.
.
2.) AML with GVHD: There was no evidence of peripheral blood
relapse.  She continued to receive her home regimen of cellcept.
 While she received dexamethasone for her neurologic condition,
her home prednisone for GVHD was held.  A bone marrow biopsy was
not not performed while an inpatient, however, this could be
considered as an outpatient.
.
3.) Hx of GIB: The patient was recently admitted for a upper GI
bleed with subsequent clipping of a visible vessel. She had
trace guaiac positive stools, but there was no evidence of
significant bleeding.  She continued to receive her home  [**Hospital1 **]
PPI, sucralfate
.
4.) Bradycardia: Following transfer back to the BMT service from
the ICU, the patient developed transient asymptomatic
bradycardia with heart rate in the upper 30's.  Her blood
pressure was normal. The rhythm was sinus.  She underwent a TTE
which revealed normal LV function and estimated filling
pressures.  By time of discharge, her heart rate had normalized.
 The most likely causes of the bradycardia was sedating
medications, high dose steroids, or physiologic causes for a
young patient.
.
5.) UTI: The patient developed dysuria without vaginal symptoms.
 She had a UA that was remarkable for elevated WBC.  She
received 3 days of ciprofloxacin.  A urine culture was pending
at the time of discharge.
.
6.) CMV viremia: On [**9-17**] the patient had surveillance CMV viral
load drawn.  The result was less than 600 copies, but not
""non-detected.""  She was started on empiric treatment with
valganciclovir with concern for rapid viral replication while on
high dose steroids.  A repeat CMV viral load was ~800.  She will
complete a 21 day course of valganciclovir.

7.) Prophy: fluc, acyclovir, bactrim, PPI
.
8.) CODE: FULL
.
9.) Dispo: home to have outpatient PT and to return to [**Hospital1 18**] to
complete XRT course. f/u appointment with hematology clinic
scheduled prior to discharge.

[**2106-12-9**]: CTA: 1.  Filling defect in the right upper lobe apical
segmental pulmonary arterial branch consistent with a pulmonary
embolism.
2.  Mosaic attenuation in the upper lobes bilaterally could
represent air trapping, small airways disease, or alveolitis.
Additionally, there are multiple areas of ground-glass opacity
predominantly in a bronchovascular distribution in the upper
lobes, left worse than right with additional areas that are more
peripherally located.  This finding is nonspecific, however,
given the patient's history, early infectious process including
opportunistic infection could be considered.  Depending on the
degree/nature of the patient's immunocompromised status,
pneumocystis jerovici could also be considered.
3.  Atelectasis in the lingula and left lower lobe.
4.  Nonspecific cluster of nodular opacities in the right lower
lobe.
.
[**2106-12-9**]: CXR: Resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia. New
left-sided pleural effusion, small
.
[**2106-12-11**]: CXR: Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is normal.
There is again seen some hazy opacity at the left base which may
represent early infiltrate versus atelectasis. There is also a
new area of increased density within the left upper lung zone,
also concerning for developing infiltrate. The right lung is
clear. There is no signs of pulmonary edema. There is a left
pleural effusion, which is small.
.
[**2106-12-17**]; CXR: 1. Persistent left upper lobe consolidation, most
likely infectious.  2. Resolution of left retrocardiac
atelectasis.
.
[**2106-12-19**]: CXR: Continued left upper lobe infiltrate
.
[**2106-12-20**]: CT Chest: 1. Left lower lobe pneumonia has resolved.
2. Generalized increase in multifocal peribronchial
infiltration, particularly left upper lobe, could be due to
either opportunistic infection, typically viral or pneumocystis,
or recurrence of graft versus host disease, less likely
hemorrhage, and not fungal or bacterial infection.  3. New
pneumomediastinum, presumably related to coughing or
bronchospasm in the absence of mediastinal fluid collection or
esophageal abnormality. 4. Multifocal air trapping, presumably
bronchiolitis obliterans.  5. Anterior extrapleural/chest wall
mass or infection, stable since [**12-9**], new since [**6-15**].
This lesion should be accessible to transthoracic needle
aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 30 yo woman with h/o AML s/p allo BMT
presenting with fever, hypoxia, a small PE and ground-glass
opacities on CT scan.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Respiratory/ID: The patient was admitted from the emergency
department to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of her severe
hypoxia (70%). She did not require intubation as she had
excellent oxygen saturations with non-invasive measures. The
source of her hypoxia was not readily identified, but possible
contributing etiologies considered were: PCP pneumonia, [**Name Initial (PRE) **] known
PE seen on CTA, atypical/fungal infection, or GVHD of the lung.
She was given broad spectrum antibiotics including vanco, zosyn,
azithro and bactrim DS 2 tabs TID.  Labs were sent as above.
Bronchoscopy was considered but there was concern she would be
unable to tolerate it given her poor respiratory status.  The
infectious diseases team was consulted.  She was transitioned to
azithro and pip/tazo to complete a 14 day course for unknown
opportunistic/atypical organism.  Her respiratory status
improved and she was transferred to the floor.  She was weaned
down from 6L O2 and was able to ambulate while on 3L.  We
discharged the patient with home O2 with goal of O2 sat greater
than 92%.  We also prescribed nebulizers (albuterol and
ipratropium).  She will return to the clinic on Sunday (two days
after dispo) for O2 monitoring.
.
# Respiratory/PE: The patient had a small PE on her initial CT
angiogram.  She was treated with heparin and transitioned to
lovenox 90mcg [**Hospital1 **].  She was continued on this upon discharge.
.
# Respiratory/Inflammation: The patient had a followup CT scan
after transfer to the floor.  It was concerning for
bronchiolitis obliterans given the airtrapping.  We increased
her steroids to 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and she continued to improve
clinically.  We also increased her cellcept prior to discharge.
.
# AML: s/p BMT and DLI. We did not notice any blasts in her
peripheral white blood cells.  We continued her cellcept and
prednisone for her history of GVH.  We also continued the
bactrim prophylaxis.  We increased the cellcept prior to
discharge.  We also added acyclovir to her prophylaxis.  We did
not start vori or fluc given her transaminitis.
.
# Nodular mass on anterior chest wall: Both of the CT chest
scans showed a nodular mass on the anterior chest wall.  We
discussed this with the radiologist and it was not clearly
infectious in etiology.  She did not have any tenderness over
this region.  We did not perform a biopsy of the lesion.  It may
need followup imaging as an outpatient.
.
# Nodular mass on right side of back: Patient had a 1cm
nontender nodular mass on the right side of her back.  It was
just deep to an ecchymotic lesion.  It was not fluctuant or
fixed.  We will monitor it during followup visits to see if it
requires dermatology evaluation.
.
# Transaminitis: The patient has a history of GVH of the liver.
Her liver enzymes gradually trended upward during her admission.
 We were concerned that it was secondary to antibiotics.  She
did not complain of any right upper quadrant or abdominal pain.
After discontinuation of the antibiotics, her enzymes trended
slightly downward.  We wanted to repeat these tests two days
after discharge when she returns to clinic.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1120**] is a 79-year-old woman
who presented to the [**Hospital6 1109**] on [**1-6**]
with complaint of chest pain which occurred following
vomiting coffee ground material.  She underwent a cardiac
catheterization which showed 40-50 percent left main,
proximal LAD, diagonal, circumflex, OM and PDA stenosis.
Unable to evaluate ejection fraction due to ectopy with
likely posterolateral hypokinesis.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], on the day of admission to
[**Hospital1 **], for coronary artery bypass grafting, but had large
volume of hemoptysis.  She was transferred to the CCU and
underwent upper GI endoscopy which revealed duodenitis,
hiatal hernia, gastritis, with no active bleeding.  She was
placed on IV Protonix, anticoagulation was stopped, and she
had no further evidence of bleeding over the next two days.
She was then cleared by the GI service to proceed with
coronary artery bypass grafting.

Cardiac Catheterizations:
[**2112-1-23**]
1. Severe three vessel disease of the native coronary arteries
with
graft occlusion of the SVG-LAD and SVG-PDA with touchdown
stenosis of
the SVG-Ramus.
2. Elevated right sided filling pressures.
3. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. PCI of the upper pole distal LAD.
5. Acute myocardial infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD - 79 year old female with CAD s/p recent CABG presenting
with chest pain, inferior STEMI, found to have two T/O vein
grafts and one 80% stenosis at the touchdown of her SVG-Ramus.
She was transferred here for emergent catheterization and her
native LAD was stented.  Post intervention she was having severe
nausea and was admitted to the CCU for further monitoring and
care.  She did well post catheterization.  She had no events and
was transferred from the CCU to the floor.  Her ASA, Plavix,
Lipitor, beta-blocker and ACE-I were continued.  She was taken
back to the catheterizion lab for intervention on her SVG-PDA.
A stent was placed in her native PDA.  She did well after her
second catheterization.  She was discharged on ASA,
Beta-blocker, ACE-I, and Plavix for 12 months.
.
2. pump- On presentation to the CCU she was felt to be fluid
overloaded by exam.  She was treated with IV Lasix.  A repeat
Echo was performed which showed: ""Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (post-op septal
motion). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.""  On discharge
her lungs were clear and she was no longer felt to be fluid
overloaded.
.
3. GI- She had presented on her last admission with GI bleed.
During this admission she was closely monitored and had no
further bleeding.  Her HCT remained stable, she had no guiaic
positive stools.  She was maintained on Protonix 40 PO BID.
.
4. Hypothyroidism - During this hospitalization she was
continued on Levoxyl.
.
5. Asthma - She was continued on Singulair and flovent inh
during this hospitalization.

6. Mild renal insufficiency - After her first catheterization
she had a slight increase in her creatinine.  She was well
hydrated prior to her second catheterization and given mucomyst
[**Hospital1 **] for 4 dosages.

7. Shoulder pain - She was evaluated by Rheumatology for her
shoulder pain.  It was felt that she would benefit from
out-patient rheumatology.

Brief Hospital Course:
     46 yo M s/p MVA unrestrained driver in MVC, t-boned other
vehicle. Pt transferred via medlflight from [**Hospital3 15402**].
Unconscious, unresponsive, not moving extremities on the scene.
Received 5-6 liters of fluid, hypotensive sating 100%, HR in the
60's. Only motor response initially biting on endotracheal tube.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], 1-2 cm laceration over left eyebrow,
cervical collar in place, PERLA, EOMI, and unresponsive to all
stimuli. Rectal with decreased tone GCS=3T.   Imaging is as
follows:

CT Head [**12-16**]
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No fracture is
seen.
2. Sinus findings as described above, some of which may be
secondary to
intubation.
3. Apparent foreign body present within the oral cavity.

CT C-spine [**12-16**]
1. Acute fracture of the right C2 lamina with multiple osseous
fragments
within the spinal canal producing narrowing of the spinal canal
at
approximately the C2/3 level. As evaluation of the intrathecal
detail is
limited on CT scans, further evaluation with MRI may be
considered.
2. Apparent sponge-like foreign body present within the oral
cavity and
oropharynx extending to the level of the epiglottis.
3. Soft tissue stranding with multiple foci of air present
within the right
posterolateral neck.

CT Chest/ABD/Pelvis [**12-16**]
1. Multiple areas of dense lung parenchymal opacity
predominantly in the
posterior portions of the lung with other areas of ground-glass
opacity and
linear opacity in the lungs. Diagnostic considerations should
include
atelectasis and aspiration. A component of contusion may also be
present.
2. Air tracking along the right iliopsoas muscle. No direct
evidence of
bowel injury is present. This air may be secondary to multiple
repeated
failed attempts at line placement in the right groin that was
conveyed by the
surgical staff.
3. Please refer to reports of head and cervical spine CT
examinations for
further details.

MRI C-spine [**12-16**]
Severe spinal cord injury at the C2 and 3 levels with edema and
hemorrhage within the cord as well as spinal cord compression
due to bony
fragments from the cervical spinal fracture. There is soft
tissue edema as
well.

Pt was taken emergently to the operating room on [**12-16**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 363**] and the orthopaedic surgery team for decompression,
hematoma evacuation, and repair of dural tear. See operative
report for details. Pt was intubated in stable condition on
pressors to the PACU.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
1. Consolidation of the right lower lobe, probably associated
with bronchial
plugging/aspiration. There is a left severe-appearing opacity at
the left
lower lobe, which probably represents a combination of
atelectasis and
consolidation.
2. No evidence of intra-abdominal, thoracic, or pelvic abscess.
3. No mediastinal mass or hematoma.

Patient maintained in stable condition on [**12-27**], sedation weaned

History of Present Illness:
53M quadraplegic s/p MVA in [**2180**]. He is chronically vent
dependent through trach, has neurogenic bladder, SVC filter on
coumadin, and pacemaker for episodes of bradycardia/asystole
with suctioning or laying flat per his wife. [**Name (NI) **] began to
experience malaise, fevers to 100 at home starting [**9-1**]. Wife
and son with URI preceding symptoms. On morning of admission to
OSH, noted to have dark urine from suprapubic catheter.

At OSH found to have leukocytosis and complete left lung
opacification on CXR. Admitted to ICU. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status beginning hospital day 4 with intermittent episodes of
tongue thrashing, head deviations, and grimacing. At baseline,
patient alert, oriented, very interactive with family.
Neurology did 20 min EEG on [**9-10**] showing slow back ground with
no Sz focus. He was started on keppra around [**9-10**] for
prophylaxis. Wife notes that pt missed several doses of baclofen
during admission.

His course was notable for multiple bronchs which revealed thick
mucous plugs that were not able to fully remove to reairate.
[**9-6**] BAL grew ecoli and klebsiella (no sensitivities reported),
TB negative. [**9-10**] BAL grew acinetobacter sensitive to zosyn and
klebsiella sensitive to cefepime, ctx, imipenem. Blood Cx [**9-5**]
grew staph epidermidis sensitive to oxacillin, cefazolin,
vancomycin and clindamycin, repeat cx [**9-14**] showed no growth.
Stool cx [**9-9**] C diff negative.Urine culture with Enterococcus
sensitive to vanco, levo, linezolid. Pt was treated initially w/
vanc and zosyn starting [**9-5**]. Of note, HCT drop 29.7 to 22.6 and
pt was transfused 4 units RBCs, no bleeding source identified.
On [**9-18**], he was transferred out of the ICU and found to have
fevers to 102, switched to vanc and cefepime.

He has a CVL since [**9-5**]. CT chest on [**9-9**] showed air
bronchograms, partial collapse on left lung. Head CT showed no
acute process. CXR [**9-18**] showed no change in left opacity w/ new
opacities on the right. Abdominal CT showed ""inflammation of the
hepatic flexure,"" colonoscopy not performed. His vent settings
are AC 450, 15, 50%. His sats were 96% and last ABG was 7.44,
43, 77 from [**9-18**]. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continuous EEG
monitoring and further evaluation. Labs prior to transfer were

IMAGING

CXR [**2187-9-19**]: COMPARISON: [**2180-12-24**]. FINDINGS:
Tracheostomy tube in situ. The patient also has a right
subclavian vein catheter, the tip of the catheter projects over
the upper SVC. The patient has received a left pectoral
pacemaker, the course and position of the leads is unremarkable.
In the interval, the patient has developed a volume loss of the
left lung, associated to a diffuse fibrotic process and pleural
thickening. In addition, a parenchymal opacity at the right
upper lobe base is seen. This opacity might be more recent and
infectious in origin. The heart continues to be mildly enlarged.
Mild fluid overload is present. The parenchymal processes, if
clinically relevant, could be further evaluated by CT.

Continuous EEG [**2187-9-20**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal
continuous ICU monitoring study. The background showed mixed
theta and delta activity, suggesting a moderate encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific. There are no epileptiform
discharges or seizures recorded

CT Guided Drainage of RUQ fluid collection [**2187-9-23**]: IMPRESSION:
Technically successful CT-guided drainage of the right upper
abdominal fluid collection yielding black fluid, uncertain
whether this is bilious or represents old blood products. Fluid
analysis is recommended. A colonic etiology should be considered
given the imaging findings. However if the fluid is bilious
consideration could be given to a perforated gallbladder.
Microbiology is pending.

CXR [**2187-9-24**]:Left lower lobe collapse is persistent. Peripheral
consolidation in the left upper lobe is unchanged. There has
been worsening of aeration in the left upper lobe likely new
atelectasis in the lingula. Right lower lobe atelectasis is
grossly unchanged. Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the
left. Tracheostomy is in a standard position. Pacer leads are in
the standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the
diaphragm. Right pigtail catheter tip is at the cavoatrial
junction.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2187-10-2**]:IMPRESSION: 1. Significant improvement in
the right pericolonic fluid collection adjacent to the hepatic
flexure of the colon. Pigtail catheter remains in place. There
is only minimal residual phlegmon within this region. 2. Stable
bibasilar airspace consolidation with atelectasis and small
bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left. Persistent
left pleural thickening and enhancement suggestive of underlying
chronic inflammation versus underlying infection as previously
mentioned. 3. Persistent soft tissue stranding in the right
flank without identifiable fluid collection. The above findings
were discussed with the resident in charge of patient, Erina
[**Last Name (un) **] at 5:50 p.m. on [**2187-10-2**]. The resident was
notified about the significant improvement of the fluid
collection since [**2187-9-21**]. Discussion was underway as to
possible removal of the right sided drainage catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 yo quadraplegic man s/p MVA in [**11/2180**],
chronically vent-dependent, who presented to an outside hospital
with fevers and AMS found to have fluid collection in colon near
hepatic flexure.

Active Issues:
# Altered Mental Status: Mr. [**Known lastname 64705**] altered mental status on
admission was likely delirium secondary to multiple factors,
possibly toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection in the
setting of recent fevers and elevated WBC. Levetiracetam started
at the OSH was continued and continuous EEG monitoring was
performed given reported jerking movements of his face and head.
No seizure activity was shown on EEG and prophylactic
levetiracetam was continued until 2 days prior to discharge with
no recurrence of involuntary movements. Pt became increasingly
more alert and was able to communicate verbally with the trach
cuff deflated.

# Right upper quadrant fluid collection: Pt was found to have a
peri-colonic fluid collection adjacent to the hepatic flexure of
unclear etiology and underwent percutaneous drainage by IR on
[**2187-9-23**] with placement of a pigtail catheter in the area of the
fluid collection. The fluid was determined to be bilious
(bilirubin 31.5, gastro-occult negative) and thought to be
related to a gall bladder perforation, but HIDA scan did not
show evidence of acute cholecystitis. Fluid cultures showed no
growth. Bilious fluid drained continuously until [**10-2**] when there
was concern that the catheter was damaged. Repeat CT abd/pelvis
on [**2187-10-2**] showed significant improvement of the fluid
collection with minimal residual phlegmon and the drain was
removed at the bedside on [**10-3**]. Since the exact origin of the
fluid collection remains unclear, he will need to follow-up for
a colonoscopy after discharge. Because he is ventilator
dependent, the procedure is scheduled to be performed  in the
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2187-11-13**]. Coumadin should be held 1 week prior to
colonoscopy.

# Respiratory failure: Patient has what appears to be chronic
left lung collapse. IP performed bronchoscopy on [**9-22**] which did
not show significant secretions to warrant treatments such as
cryotherapy to break up secretions and recruitment maneuvers
have not been able to open up airways. Left pleural effusing was
not thought to be large enough to warrent US/CT guided drainage.
A BAL grew Pseudomonas and Klebsiella for which he completed a
10 day course of meropenem on [**9-28**]. BAL also grew
Stenotrophomonas which was questionable for colonization rather
than infection, but he completed 8 day course of Bactrim on
[**10-2**]. He does not require further ID follow-up.

# Constipation: Patient was constipated for several days while
he was on tube feeds and dilated loops of small bowel seen on
KUB were suggestive of ileus. He began to have bowel movements
again after his bowel regimen was optimized and he was started
on a regular diet once his mental status improved.

# Edema: Patient has edema at baseline. Home furosemide dose was
started after confirmation of his home meds but patient was net
positive 13L at time of discharge. He had brisk diuresis to IV
lasix, but not to his PO regimen, possible to to bowel edema. On
discharge, his lasix was changed to torsemide 20mg PO BID. He
will need follow-up of his electrolyte panel after discharge.

# Repetitive facial movements: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had repetitive facial
movements early during admission which resolved after restarting
baclofen. 24 hour EEG was negative and prophylactic Keppra was
discontinued 2 days prior to discharge.

# Hypertension: Pt experienced intermittent episodes of HTN with
systolic blood pressures >180. These episodes seemed to
correlate with agitation and discomfort. Pain control was
optimized and hydralazine boluses were used to treat sustained
sbp >180. At the time of discharge, his blood pressures were at
his baseline with SBP in the 100s.

# Pain: Patient was monitored for pain control and treated with
his home dose of methadone 15mg [**Hospital1 **] prn.

# Coagulopathy.  Likely due to poor nutrition and prolonged
antibiotics. Coumadin was held due to supratherapeutic INR (6)
on admission but home dose was restarted at discharge. He will
need to have a repeat INR as an outpatient.

# Anemia: Per OSH report, he received 4 units PRBCs prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], but the circumstances were unclear. His HCT
during admission decreased from 35.7 to 25.2 with no signs of
active bleeding. Workup for hemolysis and DIC was negative. He
had no signs of active bleeding and remained hemodynamically
stable without transfusion. This may be related to hemodilution
as his fluid balance was net positive as noted above.

Inactive Issues:
# Quadraplegia: Pt has been quadriplegic following remote MVA in
11/[**2180**]. Routine care was continued throughout admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].  You were
transferred here with fevers and delirium and were found to have
a fluid pocket in your abdomen which was drained. You also had
difficulty with your breathing for which we increased your
ventilation support and treated you for a lung infection. You
will be readmitted to the ICU for a colonoscopy on [**11-13**] to
further evaluate the cause of this abdominal fluid collection.

The following changes were made to your medications;
1. START Torsemide 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
2. STOP Furosemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
3. RESTART Warfarin as you were taking it prior to this
admission

Followup Instructions:
You will be directly readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-13**], [**2187**], for your colonoscopy. Please stop taking your warfarin
1 week prior to this date.

Also, please call your PCP to schedule [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow up appointment
for next week.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous abdominal drainage


History of Present Illness:
53M quadraplegic s/p MVA in [**2180**], chronically vent
dependent through trach, neurogenic bladder, SVC filter on
coumadin, and pacemaker for episodes of bradycardia/asystole who
presents after a recent hospitalization for sepsis with
lethargy, a fever, and inability to speak or eat. He was
discharged from the hospital on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**10-5**] and was
near his baseline at home over the weekend. On the day of
admission his wife noted that he was agitated, speaking in
nonsense words, was febrile and speaking in nonsense words. He
was reportedly swearing at the VNAs, which is uncharacteristic
for him. He endorses ongoing abdominal pain which predates his
previous admission, loose stools since a bowel prep was
attempted during his previous admission, and nausea. His blood
glucose was elevated in the 200s today. He did not have any
changes in his secretions and no blood in his secretions. Loss
of appetite today whereas he usually eats a regular diet.

On [**9-14**] the patient presented to an OSH with a fever x 2 days.
Work up
there demonstrated vent associated pneumonia and mucus plug of L
lung, and transaminitis. He was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics. During his hospitalization at the OSH, the patient
had a CT abdomen demonstrating colonic thickening at the hepatic
flexure. He required 4 units of blood (circumstances unclear
from
the OSH documentation).The patient had continued fevers and
leukocytosis despite antibiotics so the family requested
transfer patient care to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-19**].

During his work-up for leukocytosis here, the patient was found
to have a fluid collection in the RUQ. An IR placed drain
produced bilious fluid. Drain was removed prior to discharge.
Also during this admission he was found to have a partially
collapsed left lung likely secondary to mucous plugging.
Multiple bronchoscopies were done to relieve the obstruction
without clinical benefit. He was also noted to have seizure
activie in the setting of missing several doses of his baclofen
and he was started on keppra. A colonoscopy was scheduled for
[**11-13**] in follow up of the hepatic flexure inflammation.

In the ED, initial VS were: Tmax 102.9 HR 86 BP 140/80 RR 18. He
received Morphine 5 mg, ondansetron 4mg ODT, Acetaminophen 650
mg. Attempts were made at bilateral femoral lines and may have
gotten artery on the left. Pressure was held for 15-20 minutes.
Was hemodynamically stable in the ED. CXR is unchanged and UA
does not show evidence of infection. In ED was more alert and
able to converse and answer questions.

On arrival to the MICU, he is alert and appropriately responsive
to questions. Wife is with the patient and provided much of the
history above.

CT Abd [**10-11**]
1.Interval development of air-fluid level in the previously seen

extraluminal pericolonic fluid collection near the hepatic
flexure of the
colon. New pneumobilia and moderate amount of air within the
gallbladder and common hepatic/common bile duct.  Suspect
fistulous communication with an adjacent hollow viscus, either
enteric or colonnic, with exact location
unknown. If there is no recent history of intervention within
the biliary
system.  Additional small pockets of air extend above and below
this hepatic flexure colonic air-fluid collection.
2.No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
3.Incompletely characterized hypodense lesions in the left mid
kidney.
Probably benign adrenal adenoma.

HIDA scan [**10-15**]
IMPRESSION: Normal hepatobiliary scan. No choledocho-colonic
fistula was
detected during the course of the scan.

CT Scan [**10-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Significantly improved extraluminal air and fluid in the
right paracolic gutter region with pigtail catheter in place.
However, there is a questionable small amount of rounded fluid
collection abutting or within the right ascending colon which
may represent a short segment loop of bowel versus a residual
loculated fluid collection.  Recommend CT sinogram before
catheter removal to ensure absent communication with hollow
viscus.
2.  Resolution of pneumobilia and air in the gallbladder with
mild amount of debris within the gallbladder.
3.  Improved but persistent right basilar subsegmental
atelectasis.  Chronic left basilar atelectasis/consolidation
with chronic left basilar pleural effusion with mild pleural
thickening.
4.  Stable splenomegaly.
5.  Stable compression deformities in the upper lumbar spine.

MICRO:
Negative stool cx x2 within last week
Negative c diff assay within last week
Pending blood cx with nothing growing

Brief Hospital Course:
53m with quadraplegia [**2-22**] MVC [**2180**] with vent dependent trach at
home who is found to have an intraabdominal abscess and colonic
fistula.

#Colonic Fistula: Recurrent.  On admission, patient was febrile
to 102.9, WBC 19.3 no bands, lactate 1.3.Intraabdominal
collection found on CT abdomen [**10-10**]. Pt went for interventional
radiology percutaneous drainage which brought up possibility of
colonic-biliary fistula. A drain was placed and put out dark
brown, purulant fluid. He was made NPO and started on TPN. CT
scan also concerning new pneumobilia and moderate amount of air
within the gallbladder and common hepatic/common bile duct. Pt
was started on zosyn and daptomycin per ID consult
recommendations.  GI and Surgery were consulted. Both teams
recommended a HIDA scan to better assess which showed no
cholonic-biliary fistula with normal biliary filling. Patient
improved on antibiotics as WBC trended down from 19.6 and
normalized with treatment. Pt remained afebrile and normotensive
following MICU admission with treatment. On [**10-23**], Mr. [**Known lastname **]
developed straw colored stool and there was concern for new
abdominal infection. A cdiff study was negative and his stool
returned to [**Location 213**] after several days. He was transiently
febrile to 101 on [**10-24**]. A repeat CT scan showed stable abdominal
collection with no signs of infection. Surgery saw patient and
decided to hold off on intervention at this time. They will see
him as an outpatient and he will receive a follow up abdominal
CT at this time. He will continue taking cipro and flagyl until
surigcal outpatient follow up on [**2187-11-8**]. RUQ drain will also
be left in until surgical outpatient follow up. He will be
continued on TPN but can have a PO diet as tolerated.

#PNA: Patient with tracheotomy tube and mechanical
ventilatr-dependent at home. Chronic left lung collapse. On
previous admission bronch did not show increased secretions
warranting therapy (ie cryotherapy to break up secretion,
recruitment maneuvers). CXR is unchanged from previous- still
has chronic left lobe collapse likely secondary to mucous
plugging. O2 saturations have been near 100% on vent. He
completed a 8 day course for ventilator associated PNA on [**10-23**].

# Altered mental status: Fever and altered mental status at home
(decreased resonsiveness, nonsense words, yelling at VNA).
Improved in ED and was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] on floor. Likely
secondary to infectious process given leukocytosis and fever. No
evidence of seizure activity. A&Ox3 for over a week and on
discharge.

# Edema: Patient has edema at baseline. Had brisk diuresis last
admission to IV lasix but not to home PO regimen. On discharge
was changed to Torsemide 20 mg PO BID. Torsemide held during
admission and not being restarted at this time. KCl held on
admission and potassium was repleted as needed.

#DVTs: Has IVC filter. INR has been stable at home per wife.
[**Name (NI) 64707**] held on admission because of anticipated drainage of
RUQ accumulation. Coumadin restarted on [**10-23**] and increased to
3mg daily.

# Anemia: On HD2 Hct dropped from 26 to 20. He received 3 units
of pRBCs and Hct improved appropriately. CT scan did not show
evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed.

# Hypertension: On last admission had hypertension to SBP>180
that responded to pain control and hydralazine boluses. He
became hypertensive and was started on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Home
toresimide had been restarted but pt became hypotensive
transiently and it was held for rest of admission.

# Pain: Takes pain medication at home. Continued on home
methadone and Lyrica for pain.

# Diabetes: Held home metformin and glimipirid in the hospital.
Was on a regular insulin sliding scale while in the hospital and
receives insulin in TPN.

# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home Alprazolam, Escitalopram
Oxalate, buproprion, buspirone. In addition, added olanzapine
2.5mg for sleep and increased anxiety,

# Quadraplegia: s/p MVA in [**2180**]. Continued home baclofen,
diazepam, tizanidine, dantrolene for spasticity. Used home bowel
regimen PRN constipation (miralax, Tums, bisacodyl, magnesium
citrate, Colace). CT showed chronically distended small and
large bowel consistent with pseudo-obstruction.

Transitional Issues:
1. Patient will follow up with surgery on [**11-8**]. He will go
for a CT scan prior to appointment. Antibiotics should be
continued until this visit. Drain will also be evaluated at this
visit
2. Pt is DNR/DNI
3. Patient needs a PT/INR drawn on [**2187-10-28**]
4. Drain should be draining to gravity with no flushes into the
cavity
5. Continue TPN as prescribed

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
You came in with a fever and signs of infection on blood work.
On CT scan we found a leak in your colon and bacteria in your
abdomen. A drain was placed and you were started on antibiotics.
We also believe you had a pneumonia and treated you with
antibiotics. Your fever resolved and on discharge there is are
no signs of infection on your blood work. You will follow up
with surgery as an outpatient on [**11-8**].

You will continue antibiotics and leave the drain in place until
you see the surgeon on [**2187-11-8**].

s/p Trach, CVA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bilateral thoracenteses

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o M with PMHx significant for Hyperchol, HTN developed
sudden onset nausea, diaphoresis, presyncope on [**2153-12-7**] while
in [**Last Name (un) 3625**] land. He was then taken to a local hospital in [**State 108**]
where he was found to have acute STEMI. He was then transferred
to [**Hospital 108**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 6185**] where he had a cath which showed
totally occluded left main, dz in R post descending and
stenoisis of proximal LAD. He immediately underwent an emergent
CABG and had 6 grafts placed. On [**2153-12-9**], he was extubated.
Soon after his extubation, he went into PEA. He then had a ?
embolic stroke with right sided hemiplegia with CT brain showing
hypodensity in Left parietal region, L external capsule region.
During his postoperative period, he developed HIT (started on
Bivalirudin) and AFib (started on Amiodarone drip). He was then
trached on [**2153-12-18**] and started on Dialysis on [**2153-12-21**] for
renal failure. During his OSH course, he developed low grade
fevers between 100-101 with all workup being negative including
Blood Cx, Urine Cx, Sputum Cx, CT chest/abd/pelvis although his
chest xray did show LLL consolidation. HE was emperically
started on Meropenem, Linezolid, Diflucan and his white count
started coming down and was afebrile for 24 hrs before transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as was wished by his
family with the plan to eventually transition him to a rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 M w/ HTN, Hyperchol p/w STEMI s/p CABG, CVA, Resp failure s/p
trach, AFib, HIT, ARF on HD
.
1) Cardiac:
a) Coronaries: Patient is s/p STEMI with emergent CABG performed
at [**Hospital 108**] hospital, 6-vessel bypass.
- BB (will try maximal blockade), ASA
- Started low-dose AceI once Cr =1.5 (in the setting of
resolving ATN)
- Lipitor initially started for modification of hyperlipidemia.
Patient had elevated CPK status-post lipitor. CK trending down
with discontinuation. Statin held for now; will need to be
re-addressed as outpatient.
.
b) Rhythm: h/o Afib during recent hospitalization.
- CHADS2 score undetermined (1 point definitely for HTN only;
unable to determine if patient has long-term CHF as cardiac
remodeling still in progress, no prior h/o DM, and cannot
determine definitively if embolic CVA related to CVA)
- Argatroban for anti-coagulation; have now bridged to coumadin
for goal INR [**2-2**]
- Initially on Amio gtt for rate/rhythm control -> tapered with
Amiodarone HCl 300 mg PO BID Duration x 7 Days (end date [**12-29**]);
then Amiodarone 300 mg daily
.
c) PUMP:
- ECHO: EF of 25% initially s/p MI on [**12-10**] at OSH
- Repeat TTE on [**12-25**] shows depressed LVEF, but unable to
quantify because of limited echo windows
- ACEI, BB
- diuretics PRN
.
2) Resp failure: was intially on IMV, switched to CPAP/PS, now
s/p trach and s/p extubation. Respiratory status was further
compromised by bilateral pleural effusions. Pt currently able to
breath with trach mask for 20-24 hours at a time but becomes
subjectively dyspneic and requests CPAP/PS for 2-4 hours after
that; this should continue to improve.
-PE unlikely, LENI's were negative, although upper ext USG
showed chronic RIJ DVT, superficial left cephalic vein thromosis

- diuresed PRN for pulm edema; however, patient auto-diuresed
with resolving ATN
- thoracenteses performed under ultrasound guidance on [**12-26**] &
[**12-28**] for large pleural effusions
.
3) Fevers: of unknown source, white count trending down
(compared to OSH). Consider nosocomial pneumonia vs. drug fever.

- Patient managed initially on Meropenem and Linezolid but
changed to Cefepime and Linezolid for VAP and good response to
fever; sputum cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) 8974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] plan for nafcillin through
[**2154-1-6**].
.
4) Stroke: Presumed embolic event, consider in the differential
DVT vs. hypokinetic cardiac thrombus s/p MI vs. PFO. Afib seems
unlikely to be the cause as the temporal relationship does not
correspond, although again this cannot be determined. Patient
with residual right side hemiplegia which correlates with
infarction of left parietal region and left external capsule
region.
- ASA; argatroban transitioning to coumadin
- Per neurology consult: recommended TTE to evaluate for PFO.
Bedside TTE [**12-23**] inadequate secondary to poor patient windows.
No bubble study performed. Patient sent for nuclear right
vetriculogram to eval for EF but again, study inadequate. Per
cardiology - although unable to see PFO - treatment would be
lifelong ASA therapy. Because patient had massive MI, he will
already be on chronic ASA therapy and finding of PFO would not
change treatment.
- bilateral UE ultrasounds: no signs of clot.
.
5) Acute Renal Failure: likely due to ATN in the setting of
hypovolemic shock
- Initially managed at OSH with HD but this measure was
discontinued after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] with resolution of ARF. HD
catheter pulled [**12-26**], tip sent for culture.
- On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient initially managed with Diuril and
IV Lasix with good response. Afterward, patient autodiuresing
well.
- renally dose meds; now corrected for improving renal function

- ACEI restarted once Cr =1.5.
.
6) Anemia: baseline HCT unknown, HCT stable compared to OSH
- transfuse for HCT <28 in the setting of recent MI and CHF
- EPO
- Hemodynamically stable
.
7) Thrombocytopenia: unclear baseline plt count; however,
downward trending from 400+ on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] to 221.
Consider Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.
- h/o HIT per OSH
- Confirmed that patient received no heparin flushes; documented
in allergy list
.
8) Hyperglycemia: patient does not carry a diagnosis of DM, now
with persistent hyperglycemia and requirement of ~60 units/day
of insulin. Initially was managed with insulin gtt; now
transitioned to NPH 25 units qAM, 10 units qHS, plus SSI for
coverage.
.
9) PPX: protonix, HOB elevation, pneumoboots. Regarding need for
anti-coagulation, patient has multiple indications, including
Afib (Chads2 score undeterminable), embolic CVA, deep vein
thrombus, HIT. Duration of anticoagulation therapy for each of
these comorbidities varies; will bridge to coumadin therapy now
with Argatroban, with plan to determine duration of therapy in
discussion with Cardiology as outpatient.
.
10) FEN: Started on tube feeds for nutritional support. S&S
study on [**12-28**] revealed patient able to tolerate pureed solids
and thin liquids. PO intake very slow at first and patient
unable to meet caloric requirements; tube feeds continued while
advancing diet. Replete electrolytes to maintain K>4, Mg>2.
- Aspiration precautions
- If pt able to continue advancing diet over next week or two,
would favor tapering tube feedings and resuming normal diet. If
not able to maintain caloric intake, will need PEG, but pt
appears able to tolerate increasing po diet for now, so
hopefully will avoid PEG with Dobhoff for now.
.
11) Access: PICC (repositioned [**12-26**]), Dialysis catheter
(discontinued [**12-26**]), Aline (discontinued [**12-23**])
.
12) Code Status: Full

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year man with coronary artery disease status 6
vessel CABG [**2153-12-7**] that was complicated by stroke (on
anticoagulation), CHF (EF 25%), pneumonia and  respiratory
failure. He is status post tracheostomy placement.  He was
readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with tachypnea from a rehabilitation
facilty.  Initial differential was chiefly CHF vs. PNA. PE
appeared less likely as INR therapeutic.  Of note the patient
had a recent pna with coag + staph, with hypoxia, tachypnea,
increased wbc. There was concern that he acquired noscomial
pneumonia.  His presentation over the next few days appeared
more consistent with a CHF exacerbation rather than a pneumonia
so the chief goal was to optimize his volume status.  A
cardiology consult was called to assist in this process.
Repeat echo revealed
EF of 40%, and a small loculated pericardial effusion, no sign
of tamponade.  The patient was started on aldactone and diuresed
aggressively with furosemide.  He had lost 7 kg in weight by
time of discharge and was negative 9L.  His lisinopril and
Toprol doses were adjusted for low BP; he was continued on
minimal doses for secondary prevention of CHF.  He will have a
repeat echocardiogram and then follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] in
cardiology at [**Hospital1 18**] upon discharge.  He should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**]
one week after discharge.  Additionally, he remained in normal
sinus rhythm.  Amiodarone was discontinued.  His INR was
supratherapeutic on discharge at 4.0.  Coumadin was held for the
two days prior ot discharge, and INR trending down.  Plan to
resume warfarin 2mg qHS when INR <3.
.
His respiratory status remained relatively stable on admission,
requiring only intermittent pressure support through the
tracheostomy.  He soon was maintain good saturation on 40% trach
mask.  His tracheostomy was closed with a ""trach button"" and he
continued to saturate well on 2L nasal cannula.  On [**2154-1-13**] his
trach was decannulated.  He is tolerating this well at the time
of discharge and continues to oxygenate well on 2Lnc.
.
In summary, this is a 62 year old gentleman with CHF (EF now
40%), CAD s/p recent CABG complicated by respiratory failure
requiring tracheostomy and complicated by CVA on
anticoagulation.  He was admitted for tachypnea/respiratory
distress likely secondary to CHF exacerbation.  Currently with
good respiratory status after diuresis and optimization of heart
failure medications.  Also in the process of gettting
tracheostomy reversed.  He is being transferred to
rehabilitation hospital at this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
On return from [**Hospital1 2025**], Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was admitted to the T-SICU for
further care on the evening of [**9-14**].  Pressors were continued to
maintain an adequate blood pressure.  He was continued on CMV to
correct his respiratory acidosis.  He responded well to
treatment and his vitals stabilized.  He gradually improved with
respect to his CV & respiratory status.  A perc trach was done
on [**9-20**], and he was weaned off the ventilator over the next 2
weeks.  He was transferred to the MICU on [**9-27**], and then was
discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab Hospital on [**2142-10-3**].

Neuro: At initial presentation, a neurology consult was obtained
to evaluate for anoxic brain injury & the possibility of brain
death.  Neuroimaging did not reveal any ischemic injury to the
brain & an EEG was not consistent with brain death, although he
was heavily sedated at this time.  The neurology team continued
to follow the patient, but signed off as he woke up & was able
to follow commands, move all extremities and communicate
clearly.

CV: After his initial CV shock, which required triple pressor
therapy, he was weaned off these pressors.  Early attempts to
wean sedation were met with hypertension & tachcardia, which
have been controlled with beta blockade & hydralazine.  He will
be discharged on oral labetalol & hydralazine.

Resp: His respiratory acidosis improved in the first few days of
this admission.  On [**9-19**], a bronchoscopy was performed, which
revealed significant mucosal burning & carbonaceous secretions.
Because of his severe smoke inhalation injuries, it was decided
that he would require a tracheostomy to wean from the vent.  A
perc trach was performed on [**9-20**].
  About HD 10, his lungs acutely decompensated, requiring
additional vent assistance.  A chest CT showed bilateral
effusions & intrinsic lung injury, and espohageal balloon
manometry revealed that he required additional PEEP.  At this
time, endotracheal cultures revealed the presence of xanthomonas
maltophila in his sputum.  With diuresis & 1 week of
antibiotics, his resp status improved.  By the time of
discharge, he is ventilating on his own via his tracheostomy.  A
Passey Muir valve was placed on [**10-1**] and he is able to speak as
well.

FEN/GI: After initial fluid resuscitation, Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was
significantly volume overloaded (about 20 kg at one point).  He
was diuresed with lasix & diamox to his baseline weight by the
time of discharge.  In addition, his electrolyte abnormalities
were corrected and his nutritional status was sustained with
enteral tube feedings.

HEME: He had several episodes of anemia, which required multiple
RBC transfusions.

ID: He was treated for a urinary tract infection on admission.
He had ventilator associated xanthomonas pneumonia, which was
treated.  All other cultures were negative.  Incidentally, he
had a nasal swab which grew out MRSA.

ENDO: His blood sugars were controlled with a sliding scale of
regular insulin.

MSK: His first degree burns on his lower back were treated with
topical bacitracin.  His initial rise in CK & troponin was
secondary to muscle breakdown and resolved spontaneously.  After
the trauma, his spine was cleared radiographically.

TOXIC: The presenting carbon monoxide intoxication resolved
after hyperbaric O2 treatment, dropping to 1% immediately.
There were no sequelae.  A possible cyanide poisoning was
empirically treated with thiocyannate.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post house fire and
carboxyhemoglobin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] is a 60-year-old
male who was found in his house after a fire to his home on
[**2142-9-14**] - apparently during which his wife was
killed.  He was unresponsive when he was found, and an
attempt at intubation was unsuccessful and then a laryngeal
mask anesthesia was placed.  He was intubated in the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room as well as
receiving a left chest tube.

In the Emergency Room, it was noted that his
carboxyhemoglobin level was 49 percent, and Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was
transferred subsequently to [**Hospital6 1129**]
for hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which was successful.  His
carboxyhemoglobin dropped down to 1 percent after that.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has no prior medical history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He did receive bilateral
laryngotomies at [**Hospital6 1129**] prior to the
hyperbaric treatment.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location **] Corner with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] does not and does not drink.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  He takes no medications at home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  He was afebrile at
99.8, heart rate was 99, his blood pressure was hypotensive
at 78/43, and his oxygen saturation was 90 percent.  He was a
paralyzed and intubated male.  His head was normocephalic and
atraumatic.  He did have an old 1-cm bump in the midline of
his forehead.  His eyes were 2 mm equal and reactive.  His
heart rate was regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs revealed he
had bilateral coarse breath sounds.  His left chest tube was
to suction without any leak.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  His back revealed abrasions
over the lower part of his back that appeared to be rug rash
from when he was dragged out of the fire.  He had no
clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or any gross deformities of his
legs and arms.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His hematocrit
was 41.8.  His coagulations were within normal limits.  His
chemistries were within normal limits.  His CK was elevated
at 14.3, with a MB fraction of only 1, and troponin was 0.03.
His carboxyhemoglobin was 1 percent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was determined to have severe
cardiovascular and respiratory distress following this fire.
He required pressors to maintain an adequate blood pressure,
and he required a ventilator to sustain him while he was in
respiratory distress.

He responded well to fluid treatment of his hypovolemic
shock, and he was gradually weaned off the ventilator.  A
percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**9-20**], which
was tolerated without any complications.  He did develop a
ventilator associated pneumonia with Xanthomonas multocida
prior to being weaned off the ventilator.  A swallow study
prior to discharge revealed slight aspiration, and he was
continued on tube feedings via a postpyloric feeding tube
when he was discharged to rehabilitation on [**10-3**].  A
more complete organ system based summary will follow.

1. NEUROLOGIC:  A Neurology consultation was originally
   obtained to evaluate for anoxic brain injury.  Magnetic
   resonance imaging and computer tomography did not show any
   ischemic injuries of the brain, and electroencephalogram
   did not show brain death.  However, as his sedation was
   lifted the patient did not show any neurological deficits
   and did well.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  After his initial shock picture, which
   responded to resuscitation and pressor treatment, he
   improved very well.  He did have hypertension and
   tachycardia over the latter half of his stay which was
   controlled with oral labetalol and hydralazine.

1. RESPIRATORY:  His initial respiratory acidosis improved
   while on the ventilator.  On [**9-19**], a bronchoscopy
   was performed which revealed mucosal injury as well as
   carbonaceous secretions.  A percutaneous tracheostomy was
   performed on [**9-20**].  Later he developed a ventilator
   associated pneumonia with associated effusions.  The
   culture results were already described.  With antibiotics
   and diuresis his respiratory status improved.  A Passy-
   Muir valve was fitted prior to discharge, and he was
   ventilating on his own on room air and was able to speak
   as well.

1. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, NUTRITION AND GASTROINTESTINAL:
   After initial resuscitation for his hypovolemic shock, he
   was volume overloaded significantly requiring active
   diuresis with Lasix and Diamox.  His nutrition was
   sustained with enteral tube feedings throughout his stay.

1. HEMATOLOGIC:  He required several packed red blood cell
   transfusions.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He was treated for a urinary tract
   infection as well as ventilator associated pneumonia.  He
   did have a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   positive nasal swab.

1. ENDOCRINE:  He required an insulin sliding scale.

1. MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient superficial burns on his
   back were treated with topical Bacitracin.  In addition,
   his cervical spine and thoracic spine and lumbar spine
   were cleared radiologically.

Catheterization showed 100% right coronary artery occlusion,
80% left anterior descending, and 90% diagonal and 80% left
circumflex, ejection fraction 45% or so.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was taken to the operating
room on [**2151-12-30**], for a coronary artery bypass graft.  The
patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit intubated and on pressor
support.  The patient was extubated on [**2151-12-30**], in the
evening same day of surgery. Neo was weaned off and the
patient was transferred to floor on [**2151-12-31**], and she was
doing well.

It was noted that she had atrial fibrillation and she was
started on Lopressor and Amiodarone.  She went in and out of
sinus tachycardia.  Beta blocker was titrated to support her
pressure and reduce her heart rate as much as possible as
well.

A blood transfusion was given on [**2152-1-2**], for a hematocrit
which had gone to 21.0 and then had risen to 28.3 with the

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old female
with a past medical history of multiple myeloma, chronic
renal insufficiency with a baseline of 2.3 to 2.8, breast
cancer, and recurrent hypercalcemia, who presented with
confusion and hallucinations.  The patient was recently
diagnosed with a UTI on [**11-28**] and was given
ciprofloxacin for a seven day course as well as Vicodin for
worsening back pain.  At the time, the patient was noted to
have poor p.o. intake as well as some vomiting.  The patient
was then noted to be increasingly confused over the next 24
hours and was therefore brought to the Emergency Room for
further evaluation.

In the ED, the patient was noted to be hyperkalemic with a K
of 7.2 and hypercalcemic with a calcium of 13.2 as well as to
be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7.5.  In the
Emergency Room, she was treated with sodium bicarb x2 amps,
10 units of insulin subQ and D50 as well as Kayexalate, and
was transferred to the VICU for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2172**], treated with melphalan
plus prednisone until [**2173-8-14**], then treated with
thalidomide until [**2176-11-13**] in which cause she was
treated with decadron.  Multiple myeloma was complicated by
multiple osteolytic metastases including ORIF of the right
femur pathologic fracture in [**2173**], upper extremity bilateral
osteolytic metastases, radiation treatment to bilateral hips
in [**2173**], compression fractures of T12, T8, L1 through L4,
right 7th rib fracture, left 5th posterior rib fracture, and
soft tissue mass of the right chest wall, also complicated by
hypercalcemia on chronic diphosphonate treatment, as well as
chronic renal insufficiency.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at the age of 78 of a MI.
Mother died at the age of 94.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.3, blood pressure
137/56, pulse 84, respiratory rate 20, and sating 92% on 4
liters.  In general, cachectic appearing female in moderate
respiratory distress.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes are dry.
Oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  JVD was at the jaw at 30
degrees.  Lungs showed positive rales half way up
bilaterally, plus wheezing, plus respiratory accessory muscle
use.  Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, regular rate, there is a +S4,
2/6 systolic murmur.  Abdomen is obese, positive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No
edema, warm.  Neurologic:  Alert, awake, oriented to person,
place, and time.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 7.2,
hematocrit 30.6, from baseline of 34.4, platelets of 89 down
from baseline of 162.  Differential:  71% neutrophils, 6%
bands, 16% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes.  Chem-7:  Sodium 129,
potassium 7.2, chloride 97, bicarb 12, BUN 69, and creatinine
7.5, glucose 116, anion gap 20, calcium 13.2 with an albumin
of 3.7, magnesium 2.4, phosphorus 7.6.  Urinalysis:  Positive
nitrite, 21-50 red, [**7-23**] white, [**1-2**] epi's, and few bacteria
on culture.  Klebsiella 10-100,000.

L spine showed multiple compression fractures:  T12, L1,
L2-L4 with progression of the L spine fractures.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral perihilar haziness, pulmonary
vascular distribution, unchanged chest wall mass, left
posterior rib fracture, and pulmonary edema.

EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, rate of 76, normal axis and
intervals, T-wave inversions in III, peaked T's in V3,
otherwise no acute changes.

Renal ultrasound:  No hydronephrosis.

UPEP showed two abnormal bands identified as monoclonal free
lambda, and trace [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein, and trace intact IgA
lambda.  There were positive urine eosinophils.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hypercalcemia:  Patient was treated with IV fluids, Lasix,
and calcitonin x48 hours with excellent response and the
calcium trending down.

2. Hyperkalemia:  Patient was treated with sodium bicarb,
insulin, glucose, Kayexalate and albuterol with excellent
response as the K came down to 5.7.

3. Acute renal failure:  Creatinine continued to rise from
7.2 to 7.5 to 7.9.  Patient received IV fluids with no
response and throwing the patient into CHF.  There was a
broad differential for renal failure including AIN secondary
to Cipro, renal toxicity from pamidronate, ATN from prerenal,
but ultimately due to the appearance of [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] proteins,
which had been negative in the past, it is felt that this is
consistent with multiple myeloma cast nephropathy.

Patient was started on hemodialysis and placed on a phosphate
binder.  Patient was dialyzed every 2-3 days during this
admission and tolerated the dialysis well.  Initially
dialyzed through a temporary left IJ line.  At the time of
this dictation, the patient set up for Interventional
Radiology placement of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter.

4. CHF:  Patient became fluid overloaded during rapid
infusion of IV fluids in the Emergency Room in the setting of
acute renal failure.  In the VICU, the patient's course was
complicated by an episode of AFib with a rapid ventricular
rate that was controlled with a diltiazem drip and eventually
with p.o. Lopressor.  An echocardiogram was performed showing
moderate left atrial dilation, mild right atrial dilation, EF
of 55%, [**2-15**]+ MR, 2+ TR.  Patient had no further problems with
fluid overload or AFib throughout her admission.

5. Coag-negative Staph bacteremia:  Although patient remained
afebrile, blood cultures were checked and revealed 4/4
bottles positive for coag-negative Staph.  The patient was
treated with Vancomycin and this was felt to be consistent
with a line infection.  Patient at this time had both right
IJ central venous catheter as well as a left hemodialysis
catheter.  The right IJ was removed, and tip sent for
culture, which also grew out coag-negative Staph.

Blood cultures continued to be positive, however, and
therefore the left hemodialysis catheter was removed.
Following the removal of this catheter, blood cultures
remained negative for 48 hours.  Patient was treated with
Vancomycin dosed by levels.  The plan was to give one further
dose of Vancomycin after the removal of the catheter was
performed.

6. Confusion:  Patient with baseline moments of confusion,
however, worsened in the setting of this acute illness.
Throughout the admission, patient with episodes of
hallucinations as well as confusion, however, remained
oriented x3.  As patient's infection improved and
electrolytes became normal, there became less and less
episodes of this confusion.

7. Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit was down from her baseline
at admission and continued to trend downward going as low as
22.5 on [**12-6**] from 34.4 at admission.  It was unclear
what this was secondary to patient was guaiac negative.
Hemolysis laboratories were unrevealing as well as peripheral
smear.  The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells
and hematocrit remained stable thereafter.

8. Thrombocytopenia:  Patient's platelets also dropped.  They
were 227 on [**10-28**], however, subsequently dropped to
130 and then down to as low as 80.  Again, there was no clear
etiology.  It was felt possibly secondary to the multiple
myeloma.  SubQ Heparin was held.  HIT antibody was sent.
This was pending at the time of dictation.

9. Multiple myeloma:  Patient's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and kept up to date throughout this stay.  His
instructions were to continue her once a week decadron for
now until she can followup once she is stabilized from this
acute renal injury.

10. Increased INR:  Patient's INR went as high as 1.9
throughout this admission.  It was felt possibly secondary to
liver dysfunction or vitamin K deficiency.  There was no
problems with spontaneous bleeding, and therefore, there was
no need for FFP.

11. Increased PTH:  Patient's parathyroid hormone was grossly
elevated at 1161.  It was unclear if this represented an
acute increase secondary to acute renal failure or
represented primary hyperparathyroidism.  The Renal team who
was on board throughout this admission was asked for their
opinion on this matter.  At the time of this dictation, that
opinion is still pending.

12. Code status:  Patient was declared DNR/DNI during this
admission.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.  Stable vital signs, had baseline
mental status, afebrile with negative blood cultures on
hemodialysis.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She will be discharged to an extended care
facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Continue her hemodialysis as
directed.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute renal failure.
2. Multiple myeloma.
3. Coag-negative Staphylococcal bacteremia.
4. Anemia.
5. Thrombocytopenia.
6. Hypercalcemia.
7. Hyperparathyroidemia.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  Includes follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
Oncology in [**3-18**] weeks as well as follow up with primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14069**] in [**2-15**] weeks, and to followup
with the Renal team as directed.

MAJOR SURGICAL AND INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Hemodialysis tunnel
catheter placement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Tamoxifen 10 mg once a day.
2. Olanzapine 2.5 mg once a day.
3. Nortriptyline 50 mg at bedtime.
4. Metoprolol 50 mg twice a day.
5. Protonix 40 mg once a day.
6. Sevelamer 1600 mg three times a day.
7. Docusate 100 mg twice a day.
8. Zolpidem 5 mg q.h.s. as needed.
9. Haldol 1 mg t.i.d. prn.

Of note, the patient did receive a number of additional
studies including a MRI of the head which revealed no brain
metastases, however, osteolytic lesions were found of the
calvarium as well as a CT of the abdomen with and without
contrast which revealed three lesions on the liver suspicious
for metastatic disease.

Service:

This is an addendum to the discharge summary dictated
[**2176-12-13**].

Since that discharge summary the patient remained in the
hospital secondary to inability to transfer.  However, there
were a number of new issues that occurred during these few
days.

1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate:  The
patient had an episode upon returning fro dialysis with rapid
atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate greater then 150
beats per minute.  The patient had one episode earlier in her
course while in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was
rate controlled with intravenous Lopressor as well as
intravenous Diltiazem and subsequently spontaneously
converted to normal sinus rhythm and has remained so for 24
hours at the time of this discharge summary.  The patient was
not to be placed on anticoagulation secondary to her
underlying coagulopathy.

2.  Low grade DIC:  Throughout her course the patient has had
low platelets and a slowly dropping hematocrit.  Over the
last couple of days the patient with INR that was elevated at
times greater then 2 and a T bili that was rising from 2.3 to
4.1.  For this reason hematology was consulted regarding
possible DIC secondary to the patient's malignancy.
Hematology felt that with a normal fibrinogen and fibrin ____
products this could be low grade DIC, but it was not
clinically significant and therefore there was no specific
treatment.

3.  Delirium:  The patient's mental status waxed and waned
throughout her admission and had improved somewhat at the
time of the last summary.  Had deteriorated somewhat in the
last few days.  The patient did receive a dose of steroids on
Saturday [**12-14**] and it was felt this may have
contributed.  However, it is most likely secondary to the
patient's illness possibly to her DIC.

4.  Coag negative staph bacteremia:  The patient will be
treated with Vancomycin for a total of fourteen days after
her left hemodialysis catheter had been pulled.  At the time
of this dictation the patient is on day seven of fourteen.
She is being dosed 1 gram for Vancomycin level less then 15.
At the time of this dictation on [**12-17**] the patient's
Vancomycin level is pending.  If it is less then 15 the
patient will receive a dose of Vancomycin.  If it is not then
the patient will need levels subsequent days and dosed
accordingly.

5.  Hemodialysis:  The patient will need hemodialysis on a
Monday, Wednesday and Friday schedule.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Tamoxifen 10 mg a day.
2.  Olanzapine 2.5 mg a day.
3.  Nortriptyline 50 mg at bedtime.
4.  Metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg a day.
6.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
7.  Haldol 25 t.i.d. as needed.
8.  Lactulose 30 cc po three times a day.
9.  Vancomycin 1 gram dosed by levels for a total of seven
days.
10.  Decadron 20 mg po once a week on Saturdays for multiple
myeloma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year-old
woman with a history of seizure disorder found down by
neighbor.  The patient had a subdural hematoma by CT along
the tentorium. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit for close neurologic observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  ETOH.
3.  Seizure disorder.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.  Heart rate 73.  Blood
pressure 134/67.  Heart rate 16.  Sats 100%.  Neurological
she was confused, moving all four extremities spontaneously.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive 3 mm.  Chest was clear
to auscultation.  Cardiac regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended.  HEENT she was in a C collar.
Extremities superficial abrasions over the left knee, also
ecchymosis over both eyes and a laceration of the left
eyebrow.  Neurologically restless and agitated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
for observation.  The patient had been sedated with 3 mg of
intravenously Ativan prior to head CT and therefore her
neurological examination was depressed.  On hospital day
number one she opened her eyes to voice.  She states she
feels fine.  She stuck out her tongue, grasp was 5 out of 5.
She was following two step commands.  Her pupils are equal,
round and reactive.  She had a repeat head CT that showed
stable appearance of the subdural hematoma.  She was
transferred to the floor on hospital day number one.  She
became acutely agitated requiring sitters.  She was started
on all of her prehospital medications, which include her
psychiatric medications and her mental status cleared.
Currently she is awake, alert and oriented times three,
moving all extremities, tolerating a regular diet and voiding
spontaneously, out of bed ambulating with assistance.  She
still has a C collar in place.  Her neck will be cleared
clinically and then she will need to have flexion and
extension films to remove the collar and that will be done
before discharge.  Her vital signs have been stable.  She has
been afebrile and physical therapy and occupational felt she
requires a short rehab stay prior to discharge to home.

graduating but primarily worked in editing for a publishing firm
and at one point as a medical researcher. She ultimately had to
quit work when she became psychiatrically ill in her 30s (also
reports this is when her seizures started), and it appears this
was all after she found her mother hanging after a suicide
attempt, and her son says she has ""PTSD"" from this event).  She
has not worked since the early [**2104**], and was divorced from her

IMAGING/STUDIES:

CT head- No acute intracranial abnormality

Right knee- Displaced and angulated fracture of the distal femur

CT C spine- No evidence of acute injury to the cervical spine.
In case of  clinical concern for cord-ligamentous injury, an MRI
can be obtained.

[**2135-4-3**] Chest PA lateral- IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest
compared to [**4-2**]: Multifocal pulmonary consolidation and
generalized interstitial abnormality continued to improve in all
areas except the perihilar right mid lung. Heart size is normal
and the mediastinal vasculature is no longer engorged. Overall
the findings are most likely due to resolving atypical edema.
Continued surveillance of a possible pneumonia in the right mid
lung; however, is appropriate. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion
if any is minimal.

[**2135-4-4**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Consider
left atrial abnormality. Low limb lead QRS voltage. Modest ST-T
wave changes. Findings are non-specific and baseline artifact
makes assessment difficult. Since the previous tracing of
[**2135-4-2**] there is probably no significant change.

[**2135-4-4**] portable CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-3**]:
Detail is severely obscured by respiratory motion. The caring
physician declined [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat examination when offered at 11 a.m.
on [**4-4**]. Cardiac silhouette has enlarged, and it is difficult to
exclude interstitial edema but right perihilar consolidation has
not cleared and remains a concern for pneumonia. Similarly
pleural effusion is hard to exclude. There is no large
pneumothorax but a small volume of pleural air would be missed.

[**2135-4-4**] CTA chest: CTA OF CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There
is marked atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic arch and arch
vessels. Coronary artery calcification is also seen. The main
pulmonary artery measures 3.9 cm, consistent with pulmonary
artery hypertension. There is a moderate hiatal hernia
containing both stomach and colon. There is no axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is patchy bilateral
ground-glass opacification throughout both lungs consistent with
pulmonary edema. There is a very small left pleural effusion.
There is no pulmonary embolism within the main, lobar, or
segmental pulmonary arteries. Within segment VII of the liver,
there are three small enhancing lesions, the largest measuring
1.6 cm. These are nonspecific, but appearance is suggestive of
peripheral shunts or vascular anomalies. BONES: There is
degenerative disc disease throughout the thoracic spine. No
osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. There
is no pulmonary embolism. 2. Bilateral patchy ground-glass
opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema. 3. Pulmonary
artery hypertension. 4. Three small peripheral segment VII liver
lesions, nonspecific, but may represent small peripheral AVMs.
If desired MRI may provide further assessment. 5. Hiatal hernia
containing stomach and colon.

[**2135-4-5**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is difficult to
assess but free wall motion is normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic and mitral
regurgitation. Mild ascending aortic dilation. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Compared with the report of the prior study
(images unavailable for review) of [**2130-2-8**], pulmonary
hypertension has progressed. There is more tricuspid
regurgitation.

[**2135-4-5**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous
radiograph, no motion artifacts are present. The lung volumes
have slightly decreased. There is unchanged cardiomegaly.
Indications of mild pulmonary edema are present and similar to
the image from [**4-3**]. In addition, a pre-existing right basal
parenchymal stone shows increased opacity that has slightly
progressed as compared to the radiographs from [**4-3**] and
[**4-4**]. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially
suggestive of small left pleural effusion. No other focal
parenchymal opacities are present.

[**2135-4-6**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of
[**4-5**], there is little change. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper
limits of normal in size and there is mild tortuosity of the
aorta. Again, there is diffuse prominence of interstitial
markings consistent with pulmonary edema as shown on the CT of
[**4-4**]. The possibility of an underlying substrate of chronic
interstitial lung disease must certainly be considered. Some
atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. Of incidental
note is diffuse osteopenia of the visualized bony elements.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 100930**] was admitted to the Orthopedic service on
[**2135-4-1**] for a right distal femur periprosthetic fracture after
being evaluated and treated with closed reduction in the
emergency room.  She underwent open reduction internal fixation
of the right femur without complication on [**2135-4-1**]. She was
extubated without difficulty and transferred to the recovery
room in stable condition.  In the early post-operative course
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 100936**] was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells
in the recovery room for post operative blood loss anemia and
subsequently transferred to the floor in stable condition.  She
was then transferred to Medicine for evaluation and management
of acute mental status changes.
.
81 year old female with h/o dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar
ataxia (wheelchair bound), and s/p remote right TKR who p/w fall
and right distal femur fracture, now POD # 2 s/p right femur
ORIF with acute mental status change.  Triggered for hypoxia
overnight.
.
# Hypoxemia- difficult to record accurate pleth given Tardive
dyskinesia.  Pt likely hypoxemic from V/Q
mismatch/intra-pulmonary shunt, as overt e/o pulm edema on most
recent Chest AP portable.  Patient still (+) 2 liters for LOS,
despite lasix 20 mg x 2.  No e/o hypoventilation.  Aspiration
pneumonia and PE were on differential, but patient not meeting
SIRS criteria (only white count), and on post-op
anticoagulation.  During the course of the day on [**2135-4-3**], the
patient had difficulty tolerating the shovel mask and n/c to
maintain oxygen saturation in the
setting of tardive dyskinesia.  She triggered again for hypoxia
and required a non-rebreather to maintain oxygenation.  Her A-a
gradient was greater than 600, see above blood gases.  V/Q
mismatch with shunt physiology was suspected as etiololgy, as
patient had no evidence of infection.  A third dose of lasix 20
mg was given, and antibiotics were changed to vanc/cefepime for
empiric coverage of HCAP.  Repeat AP portable chest films showed
improving atypical pulm edema with possible infiltrate in RML.
Given worsening hypoxia, patient was transfered to the MICU on
[**2135-4-3**]. She was initially on NRB but weaned to face mask and
then to nasal cannula over 2-3 days in the setting of diuresis
with IV furosemide. She was not treated for pneumonia, as it was
felt that other etiologies could explain the patient's
leukocytosis (recent surgery, UTI) and hypoxia (volume
overload). She did not have cough and was unable to make a
sputum sample for analysis. Urine legionella antigen was
negative. An echocardiogram was obtained to assess for CHF
(results as above). Once the patient was stable on O2 by nasal
canula, she was transferred back to the medicine floor on
[**2135-4-6**].  Following transfer, patient was given one more dose of
lasix.  Her renal function worsened in the setting of diuresis.
There was a concern for aspiration, and the decision was made by
the patient's family to defer speech and swallow eval and to
allow her to eat despite risk of aspiration; she was maintained
on aspiration precautions.  Hypoxia persisted, and the patient
was treated for aspiration pneumonia.  Oxygen requirement did
improve over the next few days, with oxygen weaned from shovel
mask and 6 liters nasal cannula to 2 liters nasal cannula.
Aspiration coverage was converted from IV to PO cefpodoxime and
metronidazole.  It is unclear what patient's baseline O2
requirements are, but even with aggressive diuresis, she has
been requiring 2L and may need to be continued on that
.
# Leukocytosis- No evidence of infection aside from Proteus UTI.
 Proteus species was found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin.
Blood cultures show no growth to date however, blood cultures
were drawn after receiving peri-op clindamycin.  C. diff toxin
returned negative. Leukocytosis trended down without any other
intervention.  Patient will complete 5 more days of cefpodoxime
and metronidazole on discharge.
.
# Altered Mental Status- Highest on differential was infection,
given >[**Numeric Identifier 4856**] Proteus bacteriuria.  Aspiration pneumonia,
bacteremia also on differential.  Hct stable, no signs of
hemorrhage, with normal vascular exam.  Patient on extensive
psychotropic regimen, but do not expect acute withdrawal at this
time.  Peri-op anesthesia also may be contributing.  The patient
was kept NPO.  Hypoxemia also likely contributing to AMS, see
above for management. During her stay in the MICU, the patient
became progressively more alert. She was oriented to person and
place as ""[**Hospital **] Hospital,"" but although she could name month
as [**Month (only) 547**] she repeatedly stated the year as [**2116**].
.
# Right distal femur fracture - patient underwent ORIF on
[**2135-4-1**] and will need to complete 4 weeks of lovenox.  She is
scheduled to follow up with orthopedic as an outpatient for
further management.
.
# Guaiac positive stool- The patient was noted to have guaiac
positive stool while in the MICU, and anticoagulation with
Lovenox was held for 2 days, but then resumed in the setting of
stable Hct.
.
# h/o depression/dementia/cerebellar ataxia- Initially PO meds
were held, but subsequently restarted on her oral medications
while in the MICU after improvement of her mental status
.
# h/o hypothyroidism - patient was continued on levothyroxine
.
# h/o HTN- patient was continued on amlodipine
.
# CODE: DNR, but intubation is permitted

Chief Complaint:
Healthcare acquired pneumonia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
81 yo F with history of HTN, hypothyroidism, depression, seizure
disorder, recent right hip ORIF complicated by pneumonia,
presents with continued difficulty clearing infection.   She had
been discharged on last admission with cefpodoxime and
metronidazole but has still done poorly.  She was transitioned
to levofloxacin on [**4-15**] which still had minimal effect.  CXR
showed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia.  She was reported to look
worse this morning, with general malaise and respiratory
distress. Her vitals at the nursing home were T 99, 02sat 93% on
2L.
.
In ED, patient received meropenem and gentamicin because she is
penicillin allergic.  Her chest x-ray showed a LLL pneumonia and
she had a white count of 15.  On transfer, her vitals were: T
98.3, HR 64 BP 108/36, RR 22, Sat 97% on 2L
.
Currently, patient reports that she feels that her breathing is
comfortable.  She never felt that she was very short of breath
at the nursing home, but was told by the staff that she was not
improving on the antibiotics that she was on.  Currently feeling
slightly nauseous, and having pain only when she is moving
around.


Past Medical History:
- Dementia.
- Depression with a history of suicide attempts (last
hospitalized on the Psychiatric Unit at [**Hospital1 18**] in 11/[**2132**]).
- Multiple falls with subdural hematoma [**2128**].
- Seizure disorder.
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on any anticoagulation
due to history of falls.
- Hypothyroidism.
- Hypertension.
- Prior STH.
- Tardive dyskinesia.
- Cerebellar degeneration with chronic ataxia.
- History of alcohol abuse.
- Hepatitis B.
- Iron deficiency anemia.

Social History:
The patient is widowed; has 2 children (son and daughter). Went
to [**University/College **]where she majored in English with a minor
in history and worked a number of different jobs after
graduating but primarily worked in editing for a publishing firm
and at one point as a medical researcher. She ultimately had to
quit work when she became psychiatrically ill in her 30s (also
reports this is when her seizures started), and it appears this
was all after she found her mother hanging after a suicide
attempt, and her son says she has ""PTSD"" from this event). She
has not worked since the early [**2104**], and was divorced from her
husband around this time as well. She had been living
independently in her own apartment until about 4 years ago but
had been failing for about the last five years of that stretch
with multiple falls which went undiscovered for days at a time.
She has been wheelchair bound for falls and cerebellar ataxia
(possibly related to extended phenytoin use) for the last 6
years or so. Her first placement was at [**Hospital1 **], where she
stayed for a year and did not like, and she has been at [**Last Name (un) **]
for the last three years.

Substance Abuse History: Per son history of alcoholism, now has
occasional weekly drinks at [**Last Name (un) **] with other residents and
son. [**Name (NI) **] is unable to specify amount. Distant history of tobacco
use, none in past 40 years. Denied knowledge of illicits.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 F with recent admission for R hip repair complicated by
aspiration pneumonia who presented with persistent hypoxia and
infiltrates.  Pt had been treated with two different courses of
antibiotics without resolution of the PNA.  She returned to the
[**Hospital1 18**] from rehab on [**4-20**] with evidence of a bilateral lower lobe
pneumonia and elevated WBC count.  She was empirically started
on Vanc and Meropenem prior to admission to the floor.  However,
she was noted to become increasingly somnolent, febrile and
hypoxic on the regular medicine floor.  She was transferred to
the ICU and HCP confirmed the code status as DNR/DNI.  Pt
underwent a speech and swallow evaluation and was cleared for a
regular diet. She was supported in the ICU with high flow oxygen
and broad spectrum coverage with Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] and Azithromycin.
She was persistently febrile and all cultures were negative for
growth.  She was transiently hypotensive and responded minimally
to bolus IVF.  CXR infiltrates became progressively worse and
oxygen requirement continued to increase.  Diuresis was
attempted but was not well tolerated due to low BPs and family
felt that CVL and pressors were not really in line with goals of
care.  CT Chest was performed on [**4-23**] and showed interval
progression of patchy infiltrates and effusions.  Lasix gtt was
started in an attempt to improve oxygenation and despite almost
1L of volume removal, pt became more hypoxic and somnolent.  HCP
made the decision to transition to comfort care on [**4-24**] and pt
was started on a morphine gtt. She expired on [**2135-4-24**] at 1410
hours. After discussing with son [**Name (NI) **], it was decided to proceed
with autopsy.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 20663**] is a 61-year-old
male with a past medical history of PAF, borderline
hypertension, asthma, who presents for an elective carotid
stent.  The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation in
[**2189-8-27**], presented to PCP initially with dyspnea on
exertion.  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation.
On physical examination, the patient was noted to have a left
carotid bruit and was referred for carotid Doppler
ultrasound.  That ultrasound in [**2190-3-27**] showed a left
internal carotid artery that had an 80-90% stenosis in the
right internal carotid artery with a 40% stenosis.  MRA of
the head on [**2190-4-2**] showed normal flow signal within
the arteries of the anterior and posterior circulation with
no evidence of vascular occlusions, stenosis, aneurysm

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife and son.  [**Name (NI) **] smoked
tobacco for approximately 80 pack year history, quit two
years ago.  He does not drink alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for dyspnea on exertion with
approximately one flight of stairs.  Positive claudication
with one flight of stairs.  He is scheduled for a vascular
study in [**Month (only) 116**].  He has no chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.  He
comes to the CCU status post left carotid stent, final
residual flow 10% with normal flow.  Follow-up neurological

chloride 105, bicarbonate 24, BUN 29, creatinine 0.9, glucose
103.

Findings at carotid artery angiography:  Left internal
carotid had an approximately 80% lesion.  This was stented
and the AC filled but faintly, principal flow from the
posterior circulation to the LMCA, MACA, from patent PCAM,
right internal carotid had a mild 30% stenosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 61-year-old male with a
past medical history of PAF, hypertension, who was found to
have a carotid bruit on physical examination.  A follow-up
carotid ultrasound revealed left carotid stenosis.  He
presented for elective carotid stenting, status post that
stent.  He presented to the CCU for monitoring.

1.  CAROTID STENT/CV:  The patient was on aspirin 325 mg
q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d., Coumadin was initially held, 0.22.
Hemodynamics: The patient had initially had a labile blood
pressure requiring a Neo-Synephrine drip.  The Neo-Synephrine
was weaned down to 0.1.  However, he still required
Neo-Synephrine for a target blood pressure of 120-130
systolic to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.  This blood
pressure goal was reached on [**2190-4-25**] and the
Neo-Synephrine was weaned off on [**2190-4-25**].  The
patient's normal angiotensive/rate-control medications were
held as his blood pressure, as stated earlier, required
Neo-Synephrine.  He was started back on his verapamil as an
outpatient following discharge, particularly the verapamil
which was started on the Thursday following admission, which
the patient was to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

2.  PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient will be
taking Plavix and aspirin for three months.  His Coumadin
will be held until that point, at which point the Plavix will
be discontinued and the Coumadin will be restarted at this
point, assessed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

3.  ASTHMA:  The patient has control of his asthma/COPD on
inhalers and Singulair.  The patient was asymptomatic during
his stay.

4.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient was followed by the attending
neurologist and the Neurology team.  There were no changes in
the neurological examination.  Adequate cerebral perfusion
pressure was maintained.  The patient did not show any
adverse sequelae from the carotid stent procedure.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged on [**2190-4-26**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Carotid stenosis, status post angiography and stenting of
the left internal carotid artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:
In MICU, placed on decadron, famotidine, benadryl given
potential allergic reaction to lisinopril with angioedema.
Started on Unasyn transitioned to Augmentin for potential sinus
infection per ENT. On PO atenolol and verapamil long acting.
Transitioned to IV metoprolol while here, then developed A fibb
with RVR into 160's. Patient was successfully extubated and
transfered to the floor.
.
On the floor, the patient was frequently complaining of throat
irritation and dryness. Decadron was discontinued. He was also
in afib with RVR which improved with changing to long acting
verapamil, but which required increased dosing. he received a
additional dose of Verapaminl SR 120mg x 1 at 1pm. Today, he
received 750cc NS at 150cc/hr in the morning for concern for
dehydration. In the afternoon, he began complaining of SOB.  He
was found to be wheezy on exam. ABG demonstrated Po2 49. Lasix
40mg IV and dexamethasone 10mg IV were given. ENT was consulted
given the concern for airway compromise. He was transfered to
the ICU. ENT performed laryngoscopy which demonstrated
subglottic swelling/hematoma but open airway. As there was no
stridor, pt able to speak and swallow, it was decided not to
intubate the patient.
.
Patient was observed in the MICU overnight and had an impressive
diuresis of >4L to his initial Lasix 40mg IV.  He was also
transitioned to a steroid taper of prednisone over a six day
course.  Upon transfer, Xopenex was discontinued for any
bronchospastic component given his tendency to develop Afib with
RVR.  Rather, he was maintained on scheduled Ipratroprium.
Coumadin continued to be held.
.
[**Hospital **] hospital course:
66y/o M with PMH of atrial fibrillation on coumadin admitted
with sublingual bleed and respiratory distress concerning for
lisinopril induced angioedema. Ultimately inflammation in the OP
improved and Pt was discharged at baseline. His hospitalization
was complicated by UTI which was treated.
.
# Urinary tract infection: Pt with rising WBC and low grade
temp. UA positive for infection. Pt also with malaise. Note: pt
was s/p foley catheter. Initially started ciprofloxacin but
remained febrile. Switched to pip-tazo. UCx and BCx ultimately
growing Pseudomonas, sensitive to cipro so dicharged on Cipro
500mg [**Hospital1 **] and DC on [**2195-12-3**].
.
# Orthostatic hypotension: Unclear if due to low volume or too
much verapemil. Was on 360mg verapemil. Decreased verapemil to
240mg and improved fluid status with boluses.
.
# Respiratory Distress - Sublingual hematoma on exam in setting
of INR of 9.8 Also consider laryngeal edema vs infection.
Unclear etiology for respiratory distress with ddx of
sub-lingual hematoma vs angioedema though **largely resolved
with patient on RA w good sats. Was treated with dexamethasone,
benadyl, h2 blocker in ICU. Re-inflamed off dexamethasone, so
discharged on prednisone taper. Holding lisinopril as a possible
cause. Dry MM was a major issue, now resolved.
.
# [**Name (NI) 100957**] INR - pt received vitamin K 10mg IV X1 and 2
U FFP in ED for INR 9.8. INR 1.5 on transfer to Medicine.
Resuming coumadin with goal INR of 2.0 per ENT and cards.
Unclear if pt was given warfarin pills at wrong dose as wife
reports the most recent prescription looked different. We ask
the pt to throw away all of his old pills and he was given
prescriptions for all new ones.
.
# Chronic atrial fibrillation - patient with episodes of Afib
with RVR in the setting of holding medications, but also on
recent Holter monitor. Initially had better rate and pressure
control on verapamil XL 360mg PO daily compared to home dose of
240, but hypotensive. Returned to home dose on [**2195-11-20**].
Resuming coumadin with goal INR 2.0

Good, stable vital signs


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with trouble breathing and with a very high
INR (normal is [**3-1**], and yours was 9.8). Because of your very
high IRN you may have bled in the soft tissues in your throat
which obstructed your airway. You were intubated and given
steroids. It is also possible that one of your medicines,
lisinopril, may have contributed to the swelling in your throat.
We have discontinued this medication. Please do not take it
again. Please throw away your old Coumadin pills since these may
not be the right dose. Finally, you developed a infection which
we treated with antibiotics. You will need to keep taking the

was drawn.  It was 7.34/22/14.  Lactate was 1.9.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Diarrhea:  The time course fits well with Xeloda toxicity.
   However, the differential diagnosis was still broad and
   stool studies were sent and were essentially negative.
   The patient on night of admission spiked a temperature of
   104.3.  Given concern for a possible infectious diarrhea
   she was started on Levofloxacin.

In addition, the patient was given bicarbonate repletion and
intravenous fluids to improve her metabolic acidosis.

The following day the patient was given broad antibiotic
coverage as her neutrophil count was continuing to fall from
the chemotherapy.  She was on ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and
Flagyl for gut protection.

As will be detailed below, the patient suffered a ventricular
tachycardia arrest and was briefly in the Intensive Care
Unit.  Following that transfer the patient was called out to
the floor.  Patient was given a peripherally inserted central
catheter line and started on TPN for parenteral nutrition.
Her diet was fully advanced from sips to clears, which she
generally tolerated, although she had a few episodes of
emesis towards the end of her stay.  The patient was started
on Imodium for control of her bowel movements and over the
course of her admission both the frequency and amount of
stool declined significantly.  At the time of this dictation
she was having just one to two bowel movements per day.

1. Ventricular tachycardia arrest:  On the second day of
   admission the patient was talking to the nurse and then
   abruptly lost consciousness.  The patient had been on
   telemetry due to abnormalities in the EKG and it was seen
   on tele as being monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular
   tachycardia leading to a VT arrest.  A Code was called.
   Right before the patient was shocked she reverted back to
   sinus rhythm.  At this point she was intubated and brought
   to the Intensive Care Unit for closer observation over the
   next three days.  The patient was extubated within 12
   hours and her electrolytes continued to improve.

A Cardiology consult was obtained and they noted that her QT
interval was significantly prolonged possibly due to
Levofloxacin, and so she was initially changed to Cipro and
then her antibiotic coverage was changed altogether.  She was
on telemetry for the duration of her admission, and there
were no further telemetry events.

In addition, she was started on low-dose beta blocker as VT
prophylaxis.  She will have this followed up as an outpatient
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**].  Moreover, while in the ICU she had an
echocardiogram that was essentially negative for any
structural disease.

1. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  As mentioned
   previously, the patient has had decreased p.o. intake over
   the past several weeks.  She was initially started on sips
   of clears and then graduated to thin liquids and then to
   full liquids, which she tolerated exceptionally.  She
   would occasionally have an episode of nausea, but these
   were generally self-limited and she was started on total
   parenteral nutrition or additional nutrition while her gut
   continues to recover.  Hopefully, she will not need to be
   maintained on TPN for that much longer.

1. Breast cancer:  The patient had a torso CT to help stage
   her malignancy.  The CT torso showed interval increase in
   the size of a left hepatic lobe metastasis and diffuse
   osseous metastatic disease.  In addition, the patient was
   noted to have this questionable tracheal compression on a
   chest film, so she had a CT trachea which showed widely
   patent airways, more extensive osseous metastatic disease,
   and pleural thickening in the right hemithorax likely also
   looked metastatic disease.  Further treatment of her
   breast cancer will be discussed with her primary
   oncologist, Drain. Come.

1. Heme:  During her Intensive Care Unit stay her INR was as
   high as 2.1 likely possible secondary to poor nutrition.
   It rapidly corrected with subcutaneous vitamin K.

1. Code:  Patient is a Full Code at time of the of this
   dictation.

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 16571**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral lower extremity and abdominal petechiae/ecchymoses,
recent onset right low back pain, and increasing weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 56 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer
who presented with bilateral lower extremity and abdominal
petechiae/ecchymoses, recent onset right low back pain, and
increasing weakness.  The patient stated that she began to
develop low back pain on the right approximately seven days PTA.
 She described the pain as dull in quality, constantly present,
and has not increased in severity since the time of onset.
There is no history of trauma to the area.  She also noted
petechiae over her abdomen and lower extremities for the past
two days PTA.  She has never experienced this in the past.
The pt. also complained of increasing weakness for the past week
PTA.  She stated that she has found it difficult to get out of
bed and is able to walk without assistance.  She noted that the
weakness has been progressive since onset.  She added that the
weakness is generalized. The patient was seen by VNA who noticed
petechiae and advised the patient to see her oncologist who sent
her to the ED.

On review of systems, the patient denied recent fever, chills,
shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, N/V/D,
constipation, abdominal pain, BRBPR, hematuria, dysuria,
arthralgias, or myalgias.  She denied headache, visual changes,
sensory disturbances, imbalance. She did admit to diffuse
weakness, but not in any one particular area.  She has had no
recent change in her appetite.  She did admit to one episode of
lightheadedness on the morning of admission after urinating.
She did not experience LOC or fall.  This has not recurred.

In the ED, the patient was found to have a low hematocrit and
platelet count.  She received one liter of normal saline.  In
addition, the patient was discovered to be hypoxemic to 89% on
room air.  A V/Q scan was performed, as was a CT of the torso.

Oncologic Hx:

The pt. was first diagnosed with breast cancer in [**2101**] status
post right mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, autologous [**Year (4 digits) 500**]
marrow transplant in [**2104**]. She has metastatic lesions to [**Year (4 digits) 500**],
liver, and lungs. She has recently discontinued from Zometa
because of elevated creatinine, metastasis to the [**Year (4 digits) 500**], liver,
and lung. Hospitalized in [**2112-12-24**], with dizziness for five
days and slurred speech. MRI showed cerebellar and pituitary
lesions, which were felt to be metastasis from her breast
primary. Neurosurgery felt that given the patient's poor
prognosis, aggressive measures were not indicated. The patient
was started on Temodar with whole brain radiation. She did whole
brain radiation from [**2112-12-29**] to [**2113-1-18**].
Recently tapered down on her Decadron over concern for
developing myopathy. Repeat MRI on [**2113-3-13**] showed substantial
but incomplete regression of cerebellar and pituitary metastases
with leptomeningeal enhancement.

Past Medical History:
1. Metastatic breast cancer first diagnosed in [**2101**] status post
R mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, auto [**Year (4 digits) 500**] marrow
transplant in [**2104**], metastatic to [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], liver, and lungs.
s/p Xeloda toxicity, was recently stopped from Zometa [**1-25**]
elevated creatinine.
2. Anemia of chronic disease, baseline Hct in mid-30's
3. Status post TRAM flap
4. H/O LUE DVT in setting of PICC line, was not anticoagulated
5. VT arrest, felt [**1-25**] prolonged QT in setting of Levaquin
6. Herpes zoster
7. Polio: as child, no residual neurologic deficits

CT torso [**2113-4-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Small scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules, which are less
prominent than in [**2109**].
2) Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
3) Innumerable hepatic metastasis.
4) Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes. No evidence of
retroperitoneal hematoma.
5) Likely right renal cyst.
6) Diffuse osseous metastatic disease.

V/Q scan [**2113-4-5**]:
Matched abnormalities at the right lung base are compatible with
the chest X-ray findings. Although there are no findings
particularly
suggestive of pulmonary embolism; pulmonary embolism in this
location cannot beruled out.

CXR [**2113-4-5**]:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease

LE dopplers [**2113-4-9**]:
1. Occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein and
nonocclusive eccentric thrombus in the right superficial femoral
vein.
2. Findings suggestive of a nonocclusive thrombus in the left
superficial femoral vein. Left popliteal vein not evaluated.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2113-4-10**]:
1) No evidence of functional bowel obstruction or perforation.
2) Unchanged appearance of innumerable hepatic metastases,
retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement, and stranding at the
root of the mesentery.
3) Diffuse subcutaneous edema and new small amounts of
indeterminant fluid in the pelvis, and thickening of the
gallbladder wall without focal inflammatory change. The
gallbladder is not overly distended, and there is no definite
evidence of acute cholecystitis. The findings are likely due to
fluid overload/third spacing, possibly secondary to
hypoalbunemia given the patient's underlying hepatic metastases.
4) Worsening bilateral lower lobe consolidations.

Echo [**2113-4-10**]:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RUQ US [**2113-4-11**]: No evidence for cholecystitis, or intrahepatic
or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

CXR [**2113-4-12**]: Unchanged appearance of the chest with extensive
predominantly basilar opacities with probable bilateral pleural
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who initially
presented on [**2113-4-5**] with c/o bilateral lower extremity and
abdominal petechiae/ecchymoses, about 7 day h/o right low back
pain, and increasing weakness. In the ED, the patient was found
to have a low hematocrit and platelet count. She received one
liter of normal saline. In addition, the patient was hypoxemic
with oxygen sats to 89% on room air. A V/Q scan was performed
and was indeterminate. CT of the torso showed progression of
metastatic disease in liver, RP, and abdomen. Her lower back
pain was thought to be associated with malignancy. Patient also
noted to have pancytopenia ( presumably related to BM
suppression/infiltration of [**Date Range 500**] marrow by mets). She was given
2 units pRBCs for HCT 20. On [**4-9**] she was noted to have
left-sided pleuritic CP. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Cardiac
enzymes were negative. LENIs (patient with dye allergy) showed R
popliteal occlusive DVT, R SFV non-occlusive DVT and L SFV
non-occlusive DVT. Anti-coagulation was held in setting of brain
metastases and thrombocytopenia. Later that evening, she spiked
to 101.6. She also complained of increased abdominal pain and
was noted to have abdominal distension. KUB showed probable pSBO
with distended loops of small bowel. NGT was placed. At 9pm,
patient noted to have SBP 60-80's. She was given 2 L IVF (NS)
boluses and sent to MICU for further care. From 2pm on, patient
in sinus tachy 120-130's. Also UOP decreased to 100cc over 6hrs.


MICU course ([**4-10**] - [**4-11**]): Blood cultures 4/17 and [**4-10**] returned
+ for G+ cocci (6/6 bottles). The source of bacteremia was not
clear. Urine culture with mixed flora. The patient was started
on Vancomycin and Zosyn. When the cultures returned with G+
cocci Zosyn was discontinued. CXR did not show new infiltrate.
The patient had RIJ line but was bacteremic before line was
placed. Line was removed on [**2113-4-11**]. CT abd/pelvis were done and
did not confirm obstruction. Per discussion with attending, the
patient's code status was changed to DNR, DNI and the patient
was transferred back to the floor on [**4-11**].

The patient was continued on Vancomycin which was then changed
to Oxacillin when the sensitivities results came back. The
patient had an episode of acute onset of shortness of breath
associated with tachycardia, increased oxygen requirements that
was followed by anxiety/agitation that was controlled with
Ativan. Diagnostic investigations were limited by patient having
a h/o allergy to contrast. However, given clinical scenario and
known LE DVT, it was felt that the patient likely did have a PE.
Given the patient's poor prognosis, limited life expectancy,
known brain mets and pancytopenia, the goal of care were
readdressed with the family. The goals of care were changed to
comfort care only. The patient was started on Morphine drip and
Ativan for comfort. She was initially continued on her other
medications to increase the chance for her family to get in
town. While her cousins and other family members arrived,
antibiotics and other medications were discontinued. The patient
expired on [**2113-4-17**]. The family declined autopsy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is status post
percutaneous nephrostomy for nephrolithiasis obstructing the
left kidney with pyelonephritis and becoming septic.

OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS:  Radical prostatectomy for which he
received x-ray therapy.
Hypercholesterolemia.
Chronic low back pain.
Osteoarthritis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient had
temperature of 101.1 degrees, blood pressure was 113/52,
pulse of 97, respiratory rate of 14, 97 percent on room air.
The patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and
time.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1
and S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation.  Abdomen was soft, obese, positive bowel
sounds, nontender, and nondistended.  No peripheral edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was scheduled for a cystoscopy.
On the day of cystoscopy, the patient became febrile to 102
degrees and then to 104 degrees very quickly over the course
of an hour or two.  It was suspected that he would get
septic, and he was deemed to high a risk for general
anesthesia and was taken to Fluoroscopy Suite where he had a
percutaneous nephrostomy on the left side.  The fluid drained
from there was stained and cultured.  It grew out Gram-
positive cocci, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.  The
growth was sparse.  The thought was that he was already on IV
antibiotics, ampicillin, and gentamicin that would have
covered other Gram-positives, possibly Streptococci and Gram-
negative bugs, so that they did not show up on culture, so he
was continued on IV antibiotics.  After the nephrostomy, he
was taken to the unit where he spent two nights until he
became more stable.  While in the unit, his blood pressures
dipped to the 90s systolic.  When he was afebrile with pulse
back up to systolic in the 120s, he was brought out of the
unit to the floor where he recovered nicely.  Also while in
the unit, he had a low potassium of 3.4 and required
supplemental potassium; and to bring up his blood pressure,
he was bolused multiple liters of normal saline.

Other important studies include a CT that showed a 1 cm stone
at the UPJ junction that was the cause of the obstruction.
During the fluoroscopic percutaneous nephrostomy, they were
able to pull that stone back, but did not extract it.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.  He was afebrile, tolerating a
regular diet, and ambulating without difficulty with pain
well controlled on oral medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Amoxicillin 500 mg t.i.d. for 14 days.
The patient was asked if he had all home medications, and he
replied yes.  After discharge, he asked for some Fioricet and
was given 10 Fioricet.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up in Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office
in 7 to 10 days.

slightly technically limited study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 61 y.o male with h.o prostate ca with fistulous and
infectious complications, pelvis osteo, PE, nephrolithiasis, HL,
chronic back and LLE pain, [**Doctor Last Name 933**], UTIs, multiple leg
debridements with presents with AMS.

# AMS- secondary to medication error and exacerbated by opiate
withdrawal.  The patient was found altered at home, given narcan
and woke up to become very combative and difficult to control.
He was treated with several medications in the ED, but needed to
be intubated to have a CT scan and LP.  His CT and LP were both
negative.  He was monitored overnight and treated with zosyn for
a supicious UA.  In the AM of his second day of hospitalization,
he woke up and self-extubated himself despite being on a
propofol gtt.  His mental status began to clear over the course
of the day, and he remember that instead of taking his 2.5 tabs
of methadone, he took 2.5 tabs of ambien.  That was likely the
cause of his altered mental status.  He was appropriate,
although somewhat somnulent, at the time of transfer from the
MICU.  Through the rest of his hospitalization, the patient's
mental status returned to baseline and he was able to be started
on his home medications without incident.

# Opiate withdrawal - Patient has opiate dependence as he has
been on chronic methadone and percocet for pain control. Pt was
given narcan by EMS which escalated his AMS.   While pain
medications were initially held while the patient was intubated,
his home regimen of opiates were restarted following extubation.


# Urostomy -Pt with h.o prostate ca s/p surgical intervention
with h.o fistulas. Now urostomy.  Although the initial UA was
positive, this was thought to represent colonization rather than
true infection.  The patient was initially treated for a UTI as
a possible source for his altered mental state.  However, after
the patient was extubated and it became clear that AMS was due
to medication/ opiate withdrawal rather than infection, all
antibiotics were stopped.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to cardiac cath on [**2125-8-3**]
showed three vessel CAD. The left main stent was widely patent.
The LAD
was chronically occluded proximally. The left circumflex stent
was
widely patent. The large lower pole of the OM1 was totally
occluded by
thrombus. The RCA had 60% proximal ISR which appeared unchanged
from
one year ago. The RCA was chronically totally occluded distally
and
appeared unchanged. The SVG-LAD was known to be occluded and was
not
injected. Successful PTCA/stenting of the large OM1 (lower
pole).

Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated filling
pressures
and low cardiac output, conistent with cardiogenic shock. Mean
RA
pressure was 16 mm Hg and mean PCW pressure was 37 mm Hg.
Moderate
pulmonary hypertension was present.

An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and patinet observed in
CCU. He was weaned off balloon pump within 24 hours.He initially
required dobutamine but was weaned on [**8-6**]. He was subsequently
transferred to the floor with stable vitals.He was continued on
ASA, plavix, statin, ACEI and lipitor

2. CHF
Echocardiogram done on [**2125-8-6**] showed EF 15-20%, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**]
dilated and elongated, RA mod dilated, akinesis of most of the
wall with relative sparing of the lateral wall, RV mildly
dilated, trace AR, mod TR, mod PAH
Patient was on ACE and decreased Digoxin to 0.0625. His digoxin
level was 1.1

3. rhythm
Patient has runs of VT with ICD in place. These episodes were
not associated with symptoms.

4.GI
He initially had some diarrhea. C diff toxin was sent and was
negative

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 yo gentleman with a significant cardiac
history including a recent admission of which he was taken to
cardiac cath on [**2125-8-3**] with PTCA/stenting and admitted to the
CCU for cardiogenic shock.  Echocardiogram done on [**2125-8-6**]
showed EF 15-20%, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated and elongated, RA mod
dilated, akinesis of most of the wall with relative sparing of
the lateral wall, RV mildly dilated, trace AR, mod TR, mod PAH.
Patient had runs of VT with an ICD in place. The episodes were
not associated with symptoms. Furthermore on that admission,
according to patient, he had suicidal ideation eg. taking whole
bottle of digoxin and had very sad affect. In house psychiatry
evaluation did not show the need for sitter. However, they
recommended psychiatry evaluation at the rehabilitation center.
He was discharged to a nursing home on [**2125-8-13**].
    He has had a decreased appetite and nausea since discharge
and has not had anything to eat in 4 days, but complains of
increased thirst.  He was been feeling very weak and tired.  He
has had frequent loose stools througout the week which stopped
yesterday.  He also had three episodes of syncope while sitting
in a chair at the rehab facility; denies any pre-syncopal
sequelea including lightheadedness, palpitations, vision
changes, nausea, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  He has
baseline shortness of breath that has been unchanged.  He says
he never experiences chest pain, but did feel 'like someone was
sitting on me' before his last admission.  He has not had that
feeling in the past week.  Feeling very down but not suicidal in
the ED.
   ED course:  Came from [**Hospital6 **], with trop 0.6 in
the ED.  Heparin started and CXR shows worsening failure. No
ischemic changes on EKG. Admit to medicine on telemetry for
medical management of symptoms and serial enzymes and EKGs to
rule out MI.   [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] aware of patient admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with multivessel CAD, s/p CABG, severe CHF (EF 15%),
discharged one week PTA after presenting with inferior MI (peak
CK 1600, trop T 8.2) for which he received a stent to his OM-1,
that hosp course c/b cardiogenic shock, now p/w progressive
fatigue, minimal po intake, and 3 episodes of syncope.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR
A. CAD: s/p CABG, recent IMI s/p OM-1 stent placement: pt was
continued on Plavix and Atorvastatin. Can't take ASA due to GIB.


B. Heart Failure: EF 10-15%, [**1-22**] recent infarct
Pt presenting in florid CHF, initially responded to Natrecor and
[**Hospital1 **] Lasix but then stoped making any progress, was transferred
to CCU for swan placement and tailored therapy.  In CCU, Lasix
was initially d/c'd and pt was cont on Natrecor alone.  Then
Milrinone was added to increase inotropy, with improved
hemodynamics based on the swan.  UO also increased. Subsequently
started on Vasopressin and Lasix drip. Natrecor was then d/c'd.
Spironolactone was added. Plan was to send the patient home on
milrinone, but pt unable to afford IV milrinone plus has shown
increased mortality. Vasopressin was tapered off, milrinone was
briefly d/c'd until pt starting having resp distress followed by
Vtach to Vfib stopped by the firing of his AICD. Milrinone was
restarted, became difficult to wean, theophylline was tried as
substitute but pt couldn't tolerate, then aminophylline was used
with success and milrinone was finally d/c'd.  Aminophylline
still has abilities to dilate renal arteries, stimulate the CNS,
and +inotropic effects but has less diarrhea and is available in
pill form.

C. Rhythm:
Patient had multiple runs of sustained v-tach during this
hospital admission. All were asymptomatic except for 2 episodes,
one where pt syncopized and recovered almost immediately, and
the other a Vtach to Vfib episode on [**2125-9-2**] when his AICD
fired. Was started on amiodarone and digoxin. ECG meets criteria
for IVCD but not LBBB so EP says no biV pacer needed.

2. PULMONARY
Hypoxia and resp alkalosis in setting of CHF likely due to
pulmonary edema, chronic effusions; responded well to treatment
of CHF, diuresis. Pt also had complication of pneumothorax,
right apical, while placing R IJ central line. Resolved
spontaneously with no chest tube required.

3. RENAL: acute (prerenal) on chronic (IGA nephropathy)
Pt was overdiuresed initially and given his low CO ended up
underperfusing his kidneys to the point of going into met
acidosis from azotemia.  Creatinine decreased gradually with
slowing of diuresis regimen.  No dialysis required, pt
asymptomatic.

4. NEURO/PSYCH: depression. Psych recommends no antidepressant
therapy at this time. No haldol/ativan/ambien/benzos given h/o
hallucinations/confusion. Aminophylline has improved pt's mood
slightly but he remains labile. Continue for now. Zyprexa qhs
for confusion.  H/o suicidal ideation on prior admission, but no
SI this admission.

5. HEME: Leukocytosis, Thrombocytopenia, Anemia - all stable.
WBC elevated since admission. Patient remains afebrile off all
antibiotics and w/u, including blood cx, urine cx, and CXR
negative.

6. FEN: poor po intake. Considered megace and marinol but not
good options given side effect profiles. Encourage po's.
Repleted lytes as needed.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1537**] is a 56 year old man who was discharged on [**8-6**] after
plasmapheresis x 5 for [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome complicated by
ileus. He was recovering at [**Hospital **] rehab when he woke on day
of admission ([**8-19**]) with dyspnea. Vital signs were obtained and
he was found to be sating 82% on 4L NC. He improved to 90% on
ventimask. Patient was sent to ED at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2195-8-19**] and went to
MICU overnight prior to transfer to medicine due to respiratory
improvement.
Patient says he has had SOB for 6 days, when he developed SOB at
rest and while lying down.  Patient has not ambulated since
discharge secondary to weakness in LE from GB.  He says he has
difficulty eating secondary to reflux, coughing, and choking on
food, and difficulty swallowing.  His SOB worsened through the
day of admission. CXR on [**2195-8-17**] at [**Hospital1 **] revealed
infiltrates in the lower lobes in addition to the RML. He was
treated with levofloxacin and Timentin at [**Hospital1 **]. He also
developed a cough productive of yellowish sputum.  He complains
of reflux that worsens his dyspnea.  The CXR at [**Hospital1 **] was
also thought to be consistent with CHF so he was diuresed with
80 mg IV lasix resulting with a UOP of 850 cc at [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was receiving standing dose of 80 mg po qd lasix at
[**Hospital1 **].
A WBC count was obtained and was elevated at 10.9 on day of
admission to MICU. Bilateral LENIs were obtained that were
negative for DVT. An EKG was obtained that showed fist degree AV
block, and nonspecific ST changes. BNP 2 days prior to admission
was high at 140  (upper limit of normal is 99). On the day of
admission, an ABG was obtained that showed 7.46/47/117.
.
As the patient had abdominal pain, an ultrasound was obtained on
[**8-17**] which showed normal gallbladder, kidneys, common hepatic
duct, pancreas, and spleen. It was remarkable for a mild right
sided hydronephrosis and bilateral renal cysts. KUB was negative
for obstruction. A day prior to admission, his lipase was found
to be elevated at 107 but his amylase was normal.
.
In the ED, he was given vanco and flagyl. Prior to this, he
received levofloxacin.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory.  Patient was sent to MICU for O2 saturation in
80's on RA.  He was treated on 4L of 02 and his respiratory
status improved.  His po medications were held, as the patient
was found to have an aspiration risk given his dysphagia.
Patient was treated for likely aspiration PNA confirmed on CXR.
He was started on IV 500 mg qd Levofloxacin and 500 mg tid IV
Flagyl x 14 days (day 1: [**8-19**]).  Patient was transferred to the
medicine floor the following day due to improvement in
respiratory status and an ABG within normal limits.  Patient was
evaluated by speech and swallow given his difficulty swallowing
secondary to his recent [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome and was placed
on aspiration precautions.   He was transitioned to PO 500 mg qd
Levofloxacin and PO 500 mg tid Flagyl after he was evaluated and
taught by speech and swallow andtransitioned to pureed solids
and nectar thick liquids, later advanced to thin liquids after
repeat video swallow. Patient was initially requiring 4L NC with
an 02 sat of 95% and his 02 requirement decreased during his
hospital stay and he was sating 95/RA on [**8-21**].
.
# Neuro: Patient was followed for his recent diagnosis of
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 30065**] [**Location (un) **] and was status post plasmapheresis x 5 prior to
readmission. On exam, the patient had 4+ strength in his LE's
and 1+ reflexes in his LE's.  The neurology service followed the
patient during his admission to ensure clinical improvement of
his symptoms and recommended pain control for his LE pain
related to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 30065**] [**Location (un) **] with Ketorlac and Morphine.  A lyme
titer was sent and was pending upon time of discharge, this lab
should be followed up outpatient.  Patient was kept on
gabapentin for pain symptoms.  Patient states neurontin makes
him drowsy in the am so dosage given in the afternoon.  Patient
given 300mg at 6pm and 11pm.  If needed and patient stable can
titrate neurotin to 300mg at 6pm and 600mg at 11pm.
.
# Renal: Patient has a history of chronic renal failure with
baseline 1.6 secondary to cystinuria for which he was taking
penicillamine. His BUN and Cr trended down during the course of
the admission and he was transitioned to oral captopril,
allopurinol and Polycitra-K for his cystinuria once he was
transitioned from NPO to liquids and pureed solids.  Patient
[**Name (NI) 8213**] and Lasix were held secondary to increased Cre, however
[**Name (NI) 8213**] restarted when Cre back to normal.  Lasix continued to be
held.  [**Name (NI) 8213**] was restarted at lower dose 25mg tid from 50mg tid,
can be titrated up if patient tolerates.  Since lasix being held
would closely watch volume status as patient with history of
flash pulmonary edema.
.
#Anemia: The patient has a documented baseline Hct of 30-35 and
a history of iron deficiency anemia.  The patient discontinued
use of iron supplementation since his previous admission given
his intolerance of iron and constipation.  His [**Name (NI) 3390**] scheduled the
patient for a capsule study and evaluation for anal nodularity
as an outpatient but it was delayed due to hospitalization.  His
HCT on [**8-21**] dropped to 24.5 from 25.1 from the day before.  He
was found to be guiac negative the evening of [**8-20**].  The patient
was transfused 1 Unit of PRBC. He was told to follow up with his
[**Date Range 3390**] regarding further workup of his anemia.  This was discussed
with his [**Date Range 3390**].
.
# FEN/GI: The patient had a lipase of 102 and amylase 150 during
his hospital stay, although he denied abdominal pain.  His
abdominal exam was followed routinely throughout his hospital
stay.
Patient was given IV fluids when NPO for his risk of kidney
stones given his diagnosis of cystinuria.
.
# CV/HTN: Patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and
flash pulmonary edema. A Cardiac catheterization in [**2195-6-23**]
showed normal coronaries. Echo on [**2195-6-2**] showed EF > 65% and
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient's po meds were held until [**8-21**] due to his dysphagia
and he was transitioned to po norvasc, captopril, ASA, lasix,
and aldactone on [**8-21**] after his evaluation by speech and
swallow.  His blood pressure and fluid status remained stable
during the course of his admission.  Lasix was held upon
discharge given rise in Cre, this can be slowly restarted as
tolerated.
.
#H/o restless legs:  The patient was restarted on  mirapex when
patient was able to take po's on [**8-21**].

left-sided consolidation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with a past medical history of chronic kidney
disease, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension
transferred from an OSH with left lower/upper lobe consolidation
is being admitted from the floor for increasing oxygen
requirement.
.
Patient was started on coumadin in [**12-4**] and has intermittently
had episodes of epistaxis relieved by cauterization. Typically
he stops or decreases his coumadin dose with improvement in his
symptoms. Six days prior to admission, patient developed
epistaxis again but did not decrease his coumadin. Then on the
day of admission, patient developed epistaxis, hemoptysis with
cough productive of sputum and blood, and difficulty breathing.
He presented to an OSH where his Hct was 35.8, Cr 1.8, WBC 14.3,
and INR 2.3. Initial CXR demonstrated left-sided consolidation.
He received 500mg levofloxacin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
because his [**Hospital1 3390**] admits to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival in the ED, temp
100.4, HR 107, BP 140/69, RR 19, and pulse ox 96% on 6L NC. Labs
were notable for elevated WBC to 16.3, INR 2.6, and creatinine
1.8. He received zosyn 2.25g x 1. His pulse ox improved to 100%
on 2L and he was initially admitted to the medicine floor.
Shortly after arrival, the patient triggered for hypoxia and he
was transferred to the MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
58 yo male with past medical history of chronic kidney disease,
GERD, and CHF was admitted with left-sided infiltrates
concerning for pneumonia and/or aspiration.
.
PLAN:
1. Left upper and lower lobe consolidation
Patient presented with left-sided consolidations. Differential
diagnosis includes the following: pneumonia, aspiration given
patient's persistent epistaxis and sleeping on his left side, or
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. CHF appears unlikely given
unilateral findings on CXR and no additional findings of
overload. PE also appears less likely in the setting of
therapeutic INR, significant infiltrate on exam. Patient still
with significant O2 requirement in the MICU, although difficult
to interpret given patient's significant baseline nocturnal O2
requirement of 7 liters due to sleep apnea.  Levo flagyl was
continued, sputum cultures were negative.  His hematocrit was
monitored [**Hospital1 **] and was stable, humidified air was used, and
coumadin and aspirin were held.  He improved and when his O2
requirement was gone he was transferred to the medical floor
where he was stable and was discharged the following day.
.
2. Epistaxis
Patient with a history of epistaxis requiring cauterization in
the past. Currently stable without persistent epistaxis although
at high risk for rebleeding. Significant risks for epistaxis
including high flow O2 by nasal canula at night.  He did not
re-bleed.  ENT was aware of this patient should he start
bleeding.  He will follow up with ENT upon discharge.

.
3. Chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.8-2.1)
Patient still within baseline, although creatinine increased
from 1.8 to 2.1 since admisison.  His creatinine stblized, lasix
was decreased to 80mh po daily.  Cacitriol and ferrous sulfate
were continued.

.
4. Atrial Fibrillation
Stable.  His coumadin and aspirin were held, and he was
instructed to discuss anti-coagulation with his [**Hospital1 3390**] upon
discharge.

.
5. GERD
Stable, continued PPI
.
6. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (diastolic CHF)
Appeared euvolemic on exam, continued [**Hospital1 8213**] - captopril 25mg PO
qid, aspirin, aldosterone antagonist - eplerenone, and lasix
It was unclear why patient is not on a beta blocker, and we
recommended outpatient follow-up
.
7. Hyperuricosuria
Stable, continued outpatient management with allopurinol 100mg
PO daily
.
8. Pancreatic Mass
Stable, continue outpatient monitoring
.
9. Cystinuria - Stable, continued captopril, consider decreasing
dose if creatinine continues to worsen but as it did not,
captopril dose remained the same
.
10. Restless Legs Syndrome - Stable, continued requip,
oxycontin, oxycodone, and gabapentin
pt's current dose of gabapentin appears quite high in the
setting of chronic renal insufficiency, recommended further
follow-up with outpatient [**Hospital1 3390**] regarding dosage
.

History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with PMH significant for diastolic heart
failure, pulmonary hypertension and stage III CKD who presented
from an outside hospital with respiratory distress, chest pain,
fever, chills and cough.  He states he had been feeling ill for
about one week with increasing difficulty breathing while at
home.

At the outside hospital, he was treated with both Lasix and a
nitroglycerin drip.  He was admitted to the intensive care unit
at [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Social History:
Works as a software engineer.  Is married with no children.
Denies any smoking or drug history; uses rare alcohol.


Family History:
Several second-degree relatives with DM2.

Physical Exam:
Gen - awake, alert, NAD, no use of accessory muscles
HEENT - OP clear
Neck - Difficult to assess JVP given thickened neck; appears
nml.
CVS - RRR, no noted m/r/g
Lungs - Decreased BS bilat w/ mild rales throughout lung fields

Abd - soft, NT/ND.
Ext - no LE edema b/l

Pertinent Results:
CXR - [**2198-1-7**]: There is a new airspace consolidation involving
the left lung (mostly upper) consistent with pneumonia. The
right lung is grossly unremarkable. A dual-lead pacemaker is
seen with leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle,
unchanged since [**2197-10-25**]. There is no pneumothorax.

CXR - [**2198-1-9**]:  A new airspace opacity has developed in the
right lower lobe since the prior day. However, there has been
considerable improvement in left upper and medial left lower
lobe opacities. There are no effusions or pneumothorax. The
heart is normal in size. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. A
dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is again noted.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: Multiple cysts are seen within bilateral
kidneys, the largest of which is located on the right and
measures greater than 16 cm. Note is made of fullness of the
right renal collecting system, similar to CT from [**2197-5-26**].
The bladder is normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 58 yo man with PMH significant for a h/o HTN, diastolic
CHF, pulm HTN who initially presented from [**Hospital3 3765**] in
respiratory distress w/ evidence of pneumonia on CXR along w/
pulm edema.
.
# Resp distress/pneumonia: The patient was originally admitted
to the intensive care unit given his level of respiratory
distress.  On admission, it was felt his shortness of breath was
most likely due to pneumonia seen on CXR along w/ component of
CHF especially given response to nitro gtt and Lasix while at
[**Hospital3 **].  The patient also had AFib with RVR while in
the intensive care unit, which was treated with IVF
resuscitation.  The patient was also treated with CTX/azithro
for a community acquired pneumonia.  He had a negative DFA for
influenza.  He did not require intubation for his breathing, but
initially did need a non-rebreather while in the unit.  He was
maintained on nasal cannula while on the floor, with his oxygen
requirement lessening each day, until he did not require oxygen
while at rest.  His ambulatory saturation did hover around
88-90% so he was sent home with portable oxygen until he is
fully recovered from his pneumonia.

He was discharged to complete a course of oral antibiotics to
treat his community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Cardiac:
A. Pump: The patient has a h/o diastolic CHF. He appeared to
have component of failure contributing to resp status above
given response to treatment of CHF which was likely contributed
to by AFib w/ RVR.  He was treated with Lasix and beta-blcokade
as needed.  He did require one additional dose of Lasix the
morning after he was called out of the unit, but was then
maintained on his home regimen without incident.  His captopril
was held throughout this admission given his acute on chronic
renal failture.  He was advised to restart his captopril at
[**Hospital3 **].

B. Rhythm: Pt w/ h/o paroxysmal AFib and is not on coumadin due
to problems w/ epistaxis. The patient was originally maintained
on telemetry after leaving the ICU.  After remaining in sinus
for >24 hours, telemetry was discontinued.  He remained in NSR
after IVF resuscitation and resolution of fever.
.
C. Cor: The patient has no h/o CAD. He did have a slight
troponin leak which was felt to be consistent with demand
ischemia.  He was briefly on a heparin gtt, which was rapidly
discontinued.  He was discharged to resume his ACE-I.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient had an elevated Cr
to 3.4 from baseline 2.1 which was likely due to infection. The
patient was given IVF in the ED & ICU. He appeared euvolemic
with mild pulmonary edema. His creatinine improved to his
baseline.  The patient was continued on his sevelamer and
calcitriol.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female who presented to the Emergency Room with acute onset
of shortness of breath.  The patient had been at her nursing
home prior to this and developed respiratory distress with an
oxygen saturation of 73% on room air which improved to 82% on
non-rebreather with an elevated blood pressure of 210/120.
She was given 40 mg IV Lasix and Nitroglycerin on transfer
with some improvement.  The patient is a poor historian
because of her chronic schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease,
but she apparently denied chest pain and stated that her
shortness of breath improved with Lasix and diuresis.

In the Emergency Department her chest x-ray was consistent
with congestive heart failure.  She had a white blood cell
count of 19.  She had acute renal failure with a creatinine
of 3.0.  Hematocrit had fallen to 25.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes mellitus.  2.
Schizophrenia.  3.  Hypertension.  4.  Congestive heart
failure.  5.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction.  6.  Parkinsonism.  7.  Anxiety and depression.
8.  Alzheimer's disease.  9.  Tardive diskinesia.

ALLERGIES:  ALLOPURINOL AND MACRODANTIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nursing home resident.  Her
healthcare proxy is her daughter [**Name (NI) 106037**], phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 106038**].
SHE IS FULL CODE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 86, blood pressure
182/71, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 100% on 5 L.
General:  She was alert and oriented to name only.  She was
in mild respiratory distress.  She has severe tardive
diskinesia with frequent lip smacking.  HEENT:  Oropharynx
clear.  Neck:  Supple.  JVP approximately 11 cm.  Chest:
Rales approximately half way up with more prominence on the
right than on the left.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac.
Regular, rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 normal.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Mildly obese.  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
pedal edema.  She had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Rectal:
Heme negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission showed a urinalysis with
moderate blood, greater than 300 protein, leukocyte esterase
positive, 11-20 WBCs.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per
minute.  She had a normal axis with occasional PVCs.  She had
old significant Q-wave in lead III with poor R-wave
progression and T-wave inversions in V6.

Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrate, right
greater than left.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient
was aggressively diuresed with progressive improvement in her
respiratory failure.  There was some difficulty controlling
her blood pressure initially, but once she had good blood
pressure control, her response to treatment was greatly
augmented.  She was taken off of the ACE inhibitor because of
acute renal failure and placed on a nitrate Hydralazine
regimen instead.

Cardiac echocardiogram was performed and showed diffuse left
ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis with an ejection
fraction of approximately 25% without significant valvular
disease.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient ruled out by
enzymes initially.  She had exercise MIBI test performed
which showed large anterior wall with non-reversible
perfusion defect, a smaller apical irreversible defect, and a
moderate sized inferior wall non-reversible defect again with
an ejection fraction of approximately 25%.  The extensive
nature of her disease was discussed with the family, and
given the high risk of coronary catheterization with the risk
of ............... to her kidneys and the uncertain benefit
the patient would derive from coronary artery bypass
procedure, it was decided to treat the patient medically.

2.  Acute renal failure:  The patient appeared to have some
component of chronic renal insufficiency at baseline with a
baseline creatinine of around 1.9.  With diuresis and careful
titration of her medications, her creatinine progressively
improved during her hospitalization stay after peaking at
about 3.4 down to a level of 2.4 on the day prior to
discharge.  Her GFR should be calculated to be approximately
20 ml/min given her age, and all medicine should be dosed
appropriately.  The patient should be on a renal diet and
continue on TUMS for phosphate binding.  She should follow-up
with a nephrologist as an outpatient for further management
of her renal disease which is most likely secondary to her
diabetes and hypertension.


3.  Diabetes mellitus:  Her blood sugars were well controlled
in the hospital, and the patient should continue on her
standing regimen of NPH with regular Insulin sliding scale
supplementation.

4.  Urinary tract infection:  The patient had a urinalysis
that appeared to be positive for urinary tract infection;
however, urine cultures showed mixed flora consistent with
fecal contamination.  We will treat the patient empirically
with a 10-day course of Levofloxacin.

5.  Anemia:  The patient appeared to have chronic anemia with
a baseline hematocrit of approximately 25.  She was heme
negative on numerous analyses.  ................... labs were
all negative, and iron studies showed adequate levels.  She
was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells during her stay
and started on Erythropoietin, as her anemia is most likely
due to her chronic renal insufficiency.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d., Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d., Epogen 3000 U subcue 2 times per week, Amlodipine
2.5 mg p.o. q.d., Hydralazine 40 mg p.o. q.i.d., TUMS 1 g
p.o. q.d., Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d., Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
every other day, Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. every other day
until [**2-29**], Dipivefrin 0.1% O.U. b.i.d., Propine 0.1%
O.U. GTT b.i.d., Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d., Tylenol 650 mg
p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. q.d., NPH Insulin
32 U subcue in the morning, 8 U subcue in the evening,
Amiodarone 250 mg p.o. q.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

DIET:  Renal.  The patient had a positive video swallow study
for aspiration during her stay, so her diet should be pureed
with honey-thick liquids.  She should be positioned
................. upright and closely monitored for signs and
symptoms of aspiration.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To her chronic care facility.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  With her regular primary care physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. ................ who should feel free to set up an
outpatient evaluation with a nephrologist of his choice.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
25%.
2.  Coronary artery disease with fixed defects.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.

Note:  This is the interim discharge summary.  Addendum will
need to be added.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old Caucasian
female with diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension,
chronic renal insufficiency as well as schizophrenia and
dementia who was discharged from [**Hospital6 649**] on [**2167-2-24**] with a diagnosis of congestive
heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency and new urinary
tract infection who now returns from her nursing home after
being found hypoxic.  The patient had been on 4 liters nasal
cannula and saturating 74%.  She had increased dyspnea and
was increasingly agitated.

During her hospital stay from [**2-18**] to [**2-24**], the patient was
found to be volume overloaded and hypertensive with
borderline cardiac enzymes with peak MB of 11.3 and C
troponin of 1.2.  She was also noted to have increased
creatinine from 1.9 baseline to 3.2 likely secondary to
intolerance of high dose angiotensin receptor blockers.  Mrs.
[**Known lastname 106040**] was diuresed and then changed to hydralazine and
nitrates with improvement in her hypoxia, blood pressure and
creatinine.  Creatinine on discharge was 2.4.  Echocardiogram
showed diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis with
an ejection fraction of 25% without valvular disease.  A
P-MIBI was conducted showing a large anterior wall fixed
defect, smaller apical fixed defect and mid inferior fixed
defect as well.  Decision was made against cardiac
catheterization given the uncertainty of benefit and also the
significant risks involved.

She received 3 units of packed red blood cells for anemia
presumably secondary to chronic renal insufficiency and
started on Epogen.  Of note, reticulocyte count was elevated.
At that time, she was discharged on levofloxacin for presumed
urinary tract infection.  Aspiration study was done at that
time which showed significant aspiration risk.

The patient is a poor historian secondary to schizophrenia
and dementia.  At admission, she reported mild shortness of
breath, no fevers, cough, chest pain, chills, palpitations,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.  In the
Emergency Department, the patient was afebrile with axillary
temperature of 95.4??????, pulse 86, blood pressure 208/63.  Chest
x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure with
consolidation of the right upper lobe.  Electrocardiogram was
nonspecific.  She was given 2 sublingual nitroglycerin x4. 2
mg of morphine, 2 inches of nitropaste, Lasix 80 mg
intravenous and then 160 mg intravenous with greater than 250
cc of urine output.  At that time, she was admitted to
medicine for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
GENERAL:  She is chronically ill-appearing 72-year-old white
female, alert, slightly tachypneic.
VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, pulse 69, blood pressure
176/66 pulse 20, 79% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
SKIN:  Warm, dry, hirsute.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Oropharynx clear, lip
swelling.
NECK:  Supple, increased jugular venous distention.
LUNGS:  Rales bilaterally on the right side [**1-13**] from the
base, on the left side [**1-14**] from the base.  No wheezes or
egophony.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1, S2, normal regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs appreciated.
ABDOMEN:  Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace lower extremity edema, no calf
tenderness.

ADMISSION LABS AND X-RAYS:  White count 20.6, hematocrit
37.9, platelets 390 with 8% neutrophils, 1% bands, 11%
lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 1% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes.
PT 12.8, PTT 23.2, INR 1.1.  Urinalysis showed specific
gravity of 1.025, pH of 3, greater than 300 protein, 100
glucose, no ketones.  Nitrite and leukocyte esterase
negative, 3 to 5 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white blood cells,
3 to 5 epis.  Chem-7 showed the following:  Sodium 136,
potassium 4.7, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 52,
creatinine 2.8 up from 2.4, blood sugar 364.  CK was 30,
troponin 0.3.  Blood cultures x2 were pending.  Chest x-ray
showed increased perihilar haziness and more prominent
interstitial markings.  There was focal opacification on the
right upper lobe which was noted on the [**2-18**] film but not on
the [**2-15**] film.  There is no effusion.  Electrocardiogram was
sinus rhythm with 92 beats per minute.  There was first
degree AV block apparent in inferior R-wave progression.
There is new T-wave inversion in V6 consistent with
electrocardiogram from [**2168-2-21**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 106040**] is admitted to the medicine
team initially on [**Hospital1 139**] and then on [**Hospital1 **].

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 106041**] blood pressure was noted
to be elevated and blood pressure control was optimized using
initially an nitroglycerin drip which was then replaced with
increasing afterload reduction with Isordil and hydralazine.
Norvasc was also increased from 5 mg up.  She was also
started on clonidine after a few days with maintenance of
blood pressure 130s to 140s systolic.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 106040**] received
cardiology consult on [**2168-3-2**] for maximization of her
hypertension medications.  She is noted to be in bradycardia
and thus her Toprol was held secondary to her heart rate.
Clonidine per cardiology consult was added on [**2168-3-4**].

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Her urine culture was noted for
Enterococcus which was ampicillin and nitrofurantoin
sensitive but Levaquin resistant.  She had been started on
Levaquin for urinary tract infection during the previous
admission.  However, this was changed to Augmentin when
sensitivities were known.

3.  RENAL:  Mrs.[**Known lastname 106041**] creatinine was noted to become
increasingly elevated and renal consult was obtained on
[**2168-3-5**].  They recommended renal ultrasound at that time to
rule out renal artery stenosis or hydronephrosis.  However,
this was found to be negative and had only increased
echogenicity of the bilateral kidneys indicating intrarenal
disease.  Initially, her increasing creatinine was thought
secondary to her congestive heart failure and poor forward
flow.  She was given fluid challenges which only resulted in
worsening pulmonary edema.  Creatinine contained a rise with
a max of 4.8 initially.  Renal artery stenosis is negative.
She is transferred to the CCU for Swan-Ganz catheterization
and inotropic support to improve urine output and renal
function.  Swan was placed with initial numbers including the
following:  Pulmonary artery pressure 76/28, wedge 30, CVP
18, cardiac output 6.1, cardiac index 3.32, SVR 721.  She was
given 240 mg of Lasix and Zaroxolyn without improvement of
urine output.  At that time, she was started in milrinone
drip which resulted in the following numbers:  Pulmonary
artery pressure 64/23, wedge 30, CVP 17, cardiac output 7
with cardiac index of 3.8.  SVR at that time was 653.  This
was declared to be unsuccessful and Swan-Ganz catheter was
removed with replacement of triple lumen central catheter
with two dedicated ports for dialysis.  At this time, she was
transferred to the floor for further management.

On [**2168-3-11**], a few hours after being transferred to the
floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] began to have increasing dyspnea, was
diaphoretic and desaturated into the 70s on 100%
nonrebreather.  Her oxygenation gradually increased with
initial arterial blood gases of the following:  pH 7.34, PCO2
41, PO2 43 which has been repeated and found to be pH of 7.3,
PCO2 40 and PO2 49.  She was given 1 inch nitropaste and 1 mg
morphine.  She was deemed to be resistant to diuresis and
this was not tried at this time.  Noninvasive pressure
ventilation was considered, but she was instead emergently
intubated and brought to the MICU for further management.
During the next few days, she underwent ultrafiltration
dialysis every two days with improvement of her congestive
heart failure.  She is extubated on [**2168-3-13**] and successfully
weaned to 2 liters nasal cannula.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 106040**] was noted to aspirate
frequently during her MICU stay.  Many of her po medications
were continued, but she was given intravenous Levaquin,
Flagyl and vancomycin for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Vancomycin had been added on [**2168-3-14**] for Staphylococcus
aureus in her sputum from [**2168-3-13**] sputum culture.  The
sensitivities are still pending.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 106040**] was also noted to have coffee ground emesis
from her nasogastric tube on beta intubation on [**2168-3-11**].
Her stools were also noted to be guaiac positive, but her
hematocrit was stable throughout.  Gastrointestinal was
consulted and recommended elective endoscopy and colonoscopy
at a later time.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 106040**] is now deemed to be stable
and is to be transferred out to the floor at this time.

STAT DISCHARGE ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**], as stated in previous discharge
summary, was admitted on [**2168-2-25**] with respiratory distress,
treated initially but unsuccessfully with diuresis.  The patient
was noted to have increasing renal failure with creatinine rising
to 4.8.  The patient was seen by renal service and felt to have
ATN.  On [**2168-3-11**], the patient had episode of respiratory
distress and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for emergent intubation.  She was dialyzed that day and
transferred back to the floor on [**2168-3-15**].  Since transfer,
issues have been the following:

currently on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  Her renal
function has not improved and her urine output is minimal.
The renal service believes that kidney function may still improve
and thus ACE inhibitors have been held.  She has been treated
with Tums for hyperphosphatemia.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] does occasionally have
increasing oxygen requirement secondary to fluid overload.
However, she is unresponsive to Lasix and does well with
dialysis.  ACE inhibitor was held, but hydralazine and Isordil
were restarted and titrated up slowly.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] has a history of atrial
fibrillation on amiodarone.  She was anticoagulated with
Coumadin, but Coumadin was held on [**2168-3-19**] and [**2168-3-20**] for
super-therapeutic INR.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] does have occasional
leukocytosis with a white cell count of 20 without left shift.
She had been started on levofloxacin and Flagyl on [**2168-3-11**] for
aspiration pneumonia.  She completed a 10 day course for this.
She was also started on vancomycin on [**2168-3-13**] for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum.  She will need
to continue this until a 14 day course is completed.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was placed on NPH 6 mg subcutaneous
[**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale insulin at transfer.  However, on [**2168-3-19**],
blood sugars were noted to be up in the 500s which were
unresponsive to sliding scale insulin.  On [**2168-3-20**], she was
started on an insulin drip with good results.  NPH was increased
to 20 units in the morning and 15 units at night with good
results.  She has been off insulin since the nighttime.

6.  NEUROLOGIC:  On [**2168-3-19**], Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] was noted to have
seizure activity, including lateral gaze bilaterally to the left
and seizure activity of the left eye and mouth.  This continued
for almost one and a half hours with occasional breaks in
seasonal activity with return to baseline in between.  She was
given a total of 10 mg intravenous Valium and loaded on
intravenous phenytoin.  She will need to continue phenytoin for
at least one week.  Neurology was consulted and thought this was
likely secondary to toxic metabolic fluids from renal dialysis
versus hyperglycemia.  Meningitis cannot be ruled out at that
time.  LP was considered but it was unlikely that bacterial
meningitis was present, as she had been on broad spectrum
antibiotics for some time, and had no further seizure activity.
CT of the head was also obtained which showed old right frontal
cerebrovascular accident and enlarged ventricles, which could
have served as a seizure focus.

7.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  As stated in previous discharge summary,
Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] had coffee ground emesis from nasogastric tube on
[**2168-3-11**], but had no further episodes.  She will need
gastrointestinal evaluation at a later time.

CODE STATUS:  Full code

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to her
nursing home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vancomycin 1 gm after hemodialysis until [**2168-3-27**]
2.  NPH 20 mg in the morning, 15 mg at night
3.  Sliding scale insulin
4.  Hydralazine 20 mg po qid

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and hypothermia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Date:  [**2137-8-27**]
PROCEDURE:
1.  Debridement of open fracture to bone.
2.  Partial excision, right clavicle.


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 59 year old homeless gentleman with h/o EtOH abuse and s/p
PEG and h/o tach (retained stoma) found down by police, and
taken to the ED. He has a h/o several ED visit in the past for
etOH intoxication (administers vodka and listerine via PEG). No
vital signs were recorded at the scene, but pt was noted to be
wet. On arrival to ED, he was found to be hypotensive with SBP
60s-70s, and hypothermic to 92.3F. ECG with suggestion of mild
[**Doctor Last Name **] waves. ABG 7.28/63/46/31 with lactate 2.7. A Bare hugger
was placed, and temp rose to 95.0F. He was given 4L NS, which
did not raise his BP significantly. A R femoral TLC was placed,
and he was started on dopamine, which was switched to levophed
after continued hypotension to 80s/40s. He was also hypoxic with
SaO2 70-80% on RA. His trach stoma was recannulated, and was
placed on AC ventilation via trach. He was given vanc/CTX for
presumed sepsis. Urine/serum tox were notable only for EtOH 311.
Mr. [**Known lastname 5621**] did not have a leukocytosis, with wbc 4.8. No
severe electrolyte abnormalities, amylase 12. CXR demonstrated
an old clavicular fracture that, on exam, had eroded through
skin with visible bone, but no acute pulmonary process. UA was
normal. CT head demonstrated areas of low attenuation in
anterior frontal lobes c/w contusion vs subacute infarct vs
edema [**2-21**] possible mass effect. This is similar to CT head read
from [**9-24**]. FAST scan was negative, and CT c-spine was negative
for fracture. CT torso demonstrated no intrathoracic or solid
organ injury, with confirmation of R clavicular fracture and old
rib fractures. He was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
Of note, previous records note several episodes of ED visits for
EtOH intoxication and hypotension to SBP 80s, responding with
IVF to 90s-100s before d/c, which appears to be his BP baseline.



Past Medical History:
1) EtOH Abuse: Several ED notes describe visits for EtOH
intoxication. Pt apparently administers vodka and listerine via
PEG.
.
2) s/p PEG and trach placement: unclear etiology
.
3) Evidence on previous ED labs of macrocytic anemia. No work-up
here.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old homeless gentleman found down, intoxicated,
hypotensive and hypothermic requiring a brief ICU course who was
being treated for an infected right clavicular fracture.  This
fracture grew out corynebacterium and the patient was undergoing
treatment with Vancomycin.  Given that the surgery was a
debridgement and not a full resection there was concern that
there was still bacteria within the bone.  Thus, the patient
would need clean-margin resection of the infected bone with
subsequent long-term antibiotic therapy at another facility.
The patient was not in agreement with these plans and after
comprehensive discussion about the risks of not completing
appropriate therapy, he exited against medical advice.
.
.
Plan:
.
#1) ID: Patient has growth of cornybacterium from open R
clavicular wound. Patient received 4 days of treatment with
Vancomycin.
.
#2) Scrotal swelling - patient had scrotal/penile swelling
following catheter removal. The patient had both a penile US and
an RUG, both showed no acute process. The patient reports that
this reaction also happened after removal of a foley at another
hospital recently and it was self-limiting.  On the day of
discharge the patient was exhibiting no signs of any penile
and/or scrotal problems.
.
#3) Hypotension: Appears to be [**2-21**] hypovolemia as a result of
decreased PO intake and EtOH induced diuresis as patient
responded well to aggressive IV hydration. Currently has SBPs
110's/50 6L IVF boluses yesterday with response in BP. Now
110's/50's-70, likely represents combination of hypothermia,
hypovolemia from poor PO intake with EtOH/hypothermia-induced
diuresis. This did not appear to be due to sepsis or adrenal
insufficiency.  The patient had stable vital aigns upon
discharge.
.
#4) Hypoxia: Patient initially on a ventilator while in the ICU.
 he was weaned promptly from the ventilator and did not require
any respiratory support during the stay on the floor.  The
patient was admitted with a tracheostomy and this was still in
place upon discharge.
.
#5) EtOH abuse: EtOH level 311 on admission. Concern for DTs-no
signs or symptoms thus far.  The patient did not exhibit any
signs of withdrawal during the hospital course.  He was
monitored via the CIWA scale and did not require any Ativan.
.
#6) Clavicle fracture:
- On the day of discharge the patient Day 4 s/p debridgement and
partial resection of the right clavicle.  He had been seen by PT
while in house and was instructed on movement such as to not
aggrevate the fracture.

Chief Complaint:
Found Down
EtOH intoxication

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old man with a history of EtOH abuse who
presented to the ED with hypoglycemia. History per records, as
pt is unable to give history. He was found by workers in the
subway tunnels, apparently intoxicated/unresponsive and with an
empty bottle of vodka. EMS was called, and FSBG was in the 40s
in the field. Unclear whether he received dextrose in the field.

.
Of note, he has had multiple ED visits in the past for
intoxication, and he takes vodka and listerine via PEG. He was
most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2137-8-20**] with hypotension
and hypothermia, due to an old right clavicular fracture which
had eroded through the skin and became infected with
corynebacterium and MRSA. He was treated with vancomycin and the
bone was debrided. Clean-margin resection of the infected bone
plus long-term antibiotic therapy were the recommended course of
treatment, but the patient did not agree with these plans and
left the hospital AMA.
.
In the ED, he aroused to voice, but was not speaking. VS: 98.8,
90, 140/80, 13, 96% on RA initially. FSBS 40s on arrival. He
received D50, as well as a banana bag with D5NS. His FSBG have
been improved. His EtOH level was noted to be 454, and the
remainder of his tox screen was negative. He has a poorly
maintainted trach and PEG (for unclear reasons) and he began
coughing mucus from the trach. He reportedly had a brief
respiratory arrest in the ED, which resolved with deep
suctioning and was presumably due to mucus plugging. He became
violent when a foley was attempted, so foley was not placed.


Past Medical History:
1) EtOH Abuse: Several ED notes describe visits for EtOH
intoxication. Pt apparently administers vodka and listerine via

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59 year old man with a history of EtOH abuse who
presents with hypoglycemia and with brief respiratory arrest in
ED. The patient was transferred to the MICU for respiratory
monitoring. The patient was then moved to the medicine floor
after becoming stable from a respiratory standpoint. The
following issues were addressed during this hospitalization.
.
1. Hypoglycemia
The pt was admitted with hypoglycemia which resolved after
getting dextrose. His glucose was monitored and there were no
further epidoses of hypoglycemia. He was hydrated with D5NS. By
the time of discharge, he was utilizing his PEG tube for
nutrition. He was maintained on thiamine and folate as well. The
hypoglycemia was most likely [**2-21**] to poor PO intake and alcohol
use. By the time of discharge, the pt was euglycemic.
.
2. Respiratory arrest/distress
The pt had some apparent respiratory arrest in ED, which was
most likely due to mucus plugging/? aspiration event. He was
maitained on aggressive pulmonary toilet with deep suctioning as
needed. CXR with no clear pneumonia, no fevers, no leukocytosis.
Repeat CXR was also clear of PNA. He was given ABx briefly for 2
days, and diagnosis of tracheobronchitis was considered. There
was no clear evidence of PNA, fever, or elevated WBC, ABx were
D/C. His sputum was positive for GPC's and GNR's on gram stain.
Sputum culture also grew Pseudomonas. Initially, the pt had
increased secretions which required more frequent suctioning
which resolved by the time of discharge. He was not felt to need
any specific additional respiratory care on follow up based on
RT assessment. He was instructed that if secretions increase
further, he may have bacterial tracheobronchitis which may
require further treatment with antibiotics. He was instructed to
[**Name6 (MD) 138**] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD or return to the hospital if this happens.
.
3. EtOH abuse
EtOH level 454 on admission. Unclear how much he drinks or when
last drink was, but clearly at risk for withdrawal. He was
placed on a CIWA scale with valium prn. He was maintained on
thiamine, folate, and MVI. He was discharged on the above
vitamins. Social work was consulted and the pt declined any

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yoM with hx of EtoH abuse, Neck CA s/p trach and peg, found
down next to a number of bottles.

# Acute Change in MS:  Mentating well upon admission.  Likely
[**2-21**] to ETOh and hyponatremia. The patient's Etoh level is 212,
which is not severely elevated but it appears as though on past
admission that he has presented with similar AMS, Etoh levels
and hyponatremia. His [**Month/Day (2) **] screen was negative. He did not have
an acidosis to suggest methanol or ethanol ingestion.  In terms
of infection, he has no fever, to leukocytosis, neg UA, no PNA
on CXR. CT head negative.  Did not develop further etiology
beyond fatigue and EtoH intoxication.  Discharged once improved
to baseline.

# Hyponatermia: Pt initially hypotensive on arrival to ED, thus
etiology may Hypovolemic hypotonic, however may be an element of
euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.
Given NS and discharged home once improved.

# Possible PNA: Pt received dose of Ceftriaxone and Levaquin
empirically in E.D for sputum production; however, pt reports
that sputum has acutally decreased. Pt afebrile without
tachycardia and leukocytosis. CXR is w/o evidence PNA.  Thus,
antibiotics were discontinued upon arrival in MICU.

# EtoH Abuse: Pt with prior hx of admissions for EtOH abuse.
EtOH level obtained on admission.  Was maintained on a CIWA
scale during stay but did not require any benzodiazepines.

# Anemia: Hct 32 at baseline

# ? Lung nodule:  This finding was reported on final report of
CXR as above after patient was discharged.  Given that patient
is homeless, and has no contact information, we were unable to
call him about this finding.  Thus, will plan to contact [**Name (NI) 89924**] Inn on the upcoming Monday to discuss follow-up with
regular providers.


Medications on Admission:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right leg ulcer; acute and chronic renal
failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, coronary
artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting
times four in [**2158**], peripheral vascular disease status post
bilateral femoral popliteal bypass, chronic renal
insufficiency and bilateral renal artery stenosis, right
greater than left.  She was admitted on [**2163-5-6**] for a right
leg ulcer.  This wound was present for one month prior to
admission; the patient was not clear if she traumatized her
leg.  It opened up one day prior to admission.  She was
treated with ten days of vancomycin, Cipro and Flagyl and had
a minor incision and drainage a few days into the
hospitalization.

On [**2163-5-9**], the patient underwent a right leg angiography,
followed a couple of days later by a kidney angiogram to
assess for graft patency and renal artery stenosis
respectively.  Thereafter, the patient developed acute and
chronic renal failure that was thought to be secondary to
contrast nephropathy.  The patient was extremely volume
overloaded and, in this context, spiked fevers and developed
hypoxia at rest.

The patient was electively intubated on [**2163-5-15**] and was
transferred to the intensive care unit for emergent dialysis
(creatinine peaked at 6.5 on [**2163-5-15**] and was 4.2 on
[**2163-5-19**]), given her pulmonary edema/hypoxia.  The patient
had been ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  A chest
x-ray had right greater than left infiltrates.  She was
status post three sessions ([**2163-5-15**], [**2163-5-16**] and
[**2163-5-17**]) of hemodialysis and was diuresed for a total of -6
to 7 liters total.  The patient extubated herself on
[**2163-5-17**] and was breathing fairly well on five liters of
nasal cannula.  She was being transferred to the floor for
further management.

The patient did feel slightly short of breath and had a
nonproductive cough which caused her belly to ache.  She did
have low grade fevers, which seemed to be associated with
hemodialysis.  She had no chills or sweats.  She had no
dysuria or frequency.  She had occasional nausea but no
vomiting.  She had no bowel movements for multiple days.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 1, on insulin.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times four in [**2158**]:  The patient had a normal
ejection fraction, 3+ mitral regurgitation and mild
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy per an echocardiogram
of [**2163-2-3**] as well as a normal stress thallium study of
[**2163-5-13**].
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
3.5 to 4:  The patient was on the wait list for renal
transplant.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral
femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2160**], done one month apart.
5.  History of cerebrovascular accident.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Bilateral renal artery stenosis--right critical and left
less than 50%.
8.  Depression.
9.  History of seizures.
10. Status post right thigh to left shin grafts times two for
wound infections from coronary artery bypass grafting in
[**2158**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature maximum
of 101.6??????F, currently 99.6??????F, with a blood pressure of 133/40
to 179/52, a heart rate of 73 to 88, a respiratory rate of 12
to 22 and an oxygen saturation of 95% on five liters by nasal
cannula.  Intakes and outputs were -7 with a weight of 60.4
kg.  In general, the patient was alert with a depressed
affect, in no apparent distress.

On HEENT examination, the head was normocephalic and
atraumatic.  The extraocular movements were intact.  The
sclerae were anicteric.  The conjunctivae were pink.  The
oropharynx was clear.  The mucous membranes were moist.  The
neck was supple with a slower left trapezius (spasms).

The chest had crackles one-third of the way up bilaterally.
The cardiovascular examination was a regular rate and rhythm
with a II/VI systolic murmur.  The abdomen had positive bowel
sounds and was soft, nontender and nondistended.  The
extremities had an ulcer on the right leg with extension down
to the tendon with some yellowish material and a very mild
area of erythema around it.  The dressing was clean, dry and
intact.  The extremities had no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
10,500, hematocrit of 34.6 and platelet count of 252,000.
There was a sodium of 142, potassium of 3.4, chloride of 100,
bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 74, creatinine of 4.2 and glucose
of 100.  Calcium was 8.6, magnesium was 1.9 and phosphate was
4.2.  Total cholesterol was 79, triglyceride was 75, HDL was
30 and LDL was 34.  D-dimer was less than 500.  Reticulocyte
count was 3.7.  TSH was 4.3 and free T4 was 0.5.  Urinalysis
was negative.  CKs times three were 30-1, 35-1 and 107-2.
Troponin i was less than 0.4.  Acetone was negative.  Serum
osmolality was 308.  The patient had a history of negative
HIV and negative hepatitis B and C screens in [**Month (only) 547**].  The
lactate level was 1.5.

Wound cultures, blood cultures and urine cultures were all
negative to date.  However, on [**2163-5-6**], the right leg had a
gram stain with no polymorphonucleocytes and no
micro-organisms with a wound culture growing rare alpha
streptococcus times two, Corynebacterium rare and rare
coagulase negative Staphylococcus.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  A [**2163-5-13**] stress test showed no defects
and no electrocardiogram changes or symptoms.  A [**2163-2-3**] echocardiogram showed mild left atrial dilatation and
mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.

RADIOLOGY:  A [**2163-5-13**] MRI of the kidney showed persistent
gadolinium in the bilateral kidneys with significant right
renal artery stenosis.  A [**2163-5-9**] right leg angiogram showed
patent bilateral femoral-popliteal grafts with slight
aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal right femoral popliteal
graft and mildly patent dorsalis pedis arteries bilaterally.
On [**2163-5-6**], PA and lateral right tibia and fibula x-rays
preoperatively showed no fracture and no destructive lesions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 46-year-old female with a history
of diabetes type 1, who presented with a right lower
extremity infection and, subsequent to receiving angiography
for her leg and kidneys, developed acute and chronic renal
failure that was thought to be secondary to contrast
nephropathy, for which she became fluid overloaded and needed
transient intubation and emergent dialysis times three.  She
was currently stable with medical intensive care unit and
prior hospital course as delineated per the History of
Present Illness.  The patient was now transferred to the
medicine service for stabilization.

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient had a chest x-ray which only
showed some persistent bilateral atelectasis with no frank
congestive heart failure or consolidation.  Despite a lack of
evidence of congestive heart failure on chest x-ray, she
responded very well to mild diuresis and was eventually
switched to her usual Bumidex for discharge.  Prior to
discharge, the patient was 100% on room air.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was hemodynamically stable
upon return to the floor.  Her antihypertensives had been
held in order to maximize perfusion to her kidneys.  She
actually had fine blood pressures without need of her
Lopressor, Cardizem, Imdur or Hyzaar.  For now, we will hold
off on antihypertensives and she will follow up with her
nephrologist to see if they need to be added back in the
future.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient remained on vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for approximately two weeks, as per
the vascular team until she had gotten her ulcer closed in
the operating room.  The patient is being discharged with
p.o. Clindamycin and ciprofloxacin as per Dr. [**Last Name (un) 22412**] of
the plastic surgery service and the length of the antibiotics
will be determined by her wound cultures, which are pending.
(Dr. [**Last Name (un) 22412**] will follow up these results.)  Of note,
the patient had no evidence of osteomyelitis on PA and
lateral tibia and fibula films.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] and was
temporarily on an insulin drip when she did not have her
subcutaneous insulin pump.  She was switched back to this and
had good blood sugars on this regimen.

5.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient had a history of seizures on
Dilantin 300 mg p.o. q.d.  She was continued for depression
on Pamelor and Remeron as well as Wellbutrin SR with p.r.n.
Valium.  She was also continued on her Klonopin.

6.  RENAL:  The patient recovered very well from her acute
renal failure and actually improved with a creatinine of 2.9.
She did diurese with Bumidex.  She was continued on
calcitriol.  Epogen was actually discontinued, as there was
thought to be no need for it.  She was started on RenaGel for
a slightly elevated phosphate level.  She only needed a total
of three dialyses.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] will follow her regarding her
bilateral renal artery stenosis to see whether or not she
still needed a transplant.

7.  RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULCER:  After the patient was
medically stabilized with rest to her pulmonary renal status,
she underwent incision and closure of her right lower
extremity by Dr. [**Last Name (un) 22412**] on [**2163-5-25**], with no
complications.  By discharge, her wound looked well and she
applied dry sterile dressings with a multi-Portex
boot--Camwalker.  The patient is partial weightbearing as
tolerated and will have [**Hospital6 407**] services.
She will continue on clindamycin and ciprofloxacin until her
next visit with Dr. [**Last Name (un) 22412**], at which time they will
decide on the length of her antibiotic solution pending wound
culture data which, at present, is preliminarily negative.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right lower extremity ulcer, status post debridement and
closure.
2.  Acute and chronic renal failure, now resolved.
3.  Respiratory failure, status post intubation.
4.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
5.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times four.
6.  Mitral regurgitation (3+).
7.  Renal artery stenosis, right critical and left of less
than 50%.
8.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral
femoral-popliteal bypasses.
9.  History of cerebrovascular accident.
10. Hypothyroidism.
11. Depression.
12. History of seizures.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Subcutaneous insulin pump:  The patient will adjust this
on her own with her endocrinologist.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d..
3.  Pamelor 25 mg p.o. h.s.
4.  Remeron 45 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, shellfish and gadolinium.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies ETOH use, quit tobacco
several years ago and lives at home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, examination revealed a
temperature of 98.3, heart rate 62 and blood pressure 134/54.
She appeared comfortable in no acute distress.  Chest was
clear bilaterally.  The heart was regular.  The abdomen was
soft, with tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with a
palpable mass, no rebound or guarding.  Rectal was guaiac
negative with stool in the vault.  There was palpation of the
posterior tibial bilaterally and the dorsalis pedis only on
the right side.  There was a skin graft which showed a
positive thrill.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
9.2, hematocrit 36.0.  Potassium 5.0, blood urea nitrogen 30
and creatinine 4.6.  INR 1.1.  All other laboratories were
within normal limits.

CT of the abdomen demonstrated a complete small bowel
obstruction with an abnormal segment in the distal jejunum
which was consistent with closed loop obstruction.

Electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, no
ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was immediately taken to the
operating room.  Prior to going to surgery, the patient had a
pulmonary artery catheter placed which immediately
demonstrated adequate cardiac output and index and good
intravascular volume resuscitation.  After hemodynamics were
established and found to be adequate, she was taken to the
operating room where exploratory laparotomy was performed and
lysis of adhesions was performed on a band which had caused a
closed loop obstruction.  After the completion of the lysis
of adhesions, all the bowel was found to be viable and the
patient was closed and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit
in stable condition.  The details of the surgery are found in
the operative note.

Postoperatively, the patient remained in stable condition
with good hemodynamics from the pulmonary artery catheter.
Electrocardiogram showed no changes.  The patient was ruled
out with cardiac enzymes times three.  She then spent the
night in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and postoperative day
number one her pulmonary artery catheter was changed to a
central venous line and she was transferred to the floor for
continuation of her care.  Postoperative day number two, the
patient remained afebrile and reported flatus and her
nasogastric tube was discontinued.  During her postoperative
course, she was followed by [**Hospital **] Clinic for her diabetes
mellitus for which she was on insulin pump and her insulin
was kept in good control.  She was also followed by the renal
fellow and she continued on her hemodialysis as an inpatient
without incident.  On postoperative day number three, she was
started on some clears, had minimal nausea and was continued
on hemodialysis.  On postoperative day number four, the
patient was advanced.  Nausea had subsided.  On postoperative
day number five, the patient reported bowel movement,
tolerating diet, ambulating and is now ready for discharge.

The patient was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] and renal and will follow-up
with them as appropriate.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions
for complete small bowel obstruction.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  History of cerebrovascular accident.

[**2167-1-8**] CXR-Patchy new opacity within the superior segment of the

[**2167-1-8**] ECG-Sinus rhythm, Long QTc interval, Probable
anteroseptal infarct, age indeterminate, Low QRS voltages in
limb leads
Since previous tracing, no significant change
[**2167-1-9**] CT Head- No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**2167-1-9**] ECHO- 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed.  EF 50%
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2165-10-3**], LV function has decreased.
[**2167-1-11**] CT Chest- 1. Extensive multifocal ground glass opacities
bilaterally. The rapid course of development compared to the
recent chest-xrays favours pulmonary edema. However, lack of
siginficant pleural effuions and upper lobe involvement argues
against pulmonary edema. Other considerations include atypical
infection and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
2. Mediastinal lymph nodes.
3. Left lower lobe and right lower lobe areas of consolidation
could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
[**2167-1-12**] CTA Chest- No evidence of pulmonary embolus. No interval
change in bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities, bibasilar
patchy consolidation, small left pleural effusion, and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy
[**2167-1-17**] MRI Head- Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of
slowed diffusion to indicate acute infarct. No evidence of mass
effect or midline shift are seen. Subtle right frontal
hyperintensities are unchanged from the previous study of
[**2165-7-14**] and [**2165-10-5**], and could be due to a chronic right
frontal cortical infarct or changes of small vessel disease.
There is no evidence of new infarct identified. The suprasellar
and craniocervical regions are normal in the sagittal images.




Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB/Respiratory Failure-Pt initially presented with SOB and
mental status changes.  She was empirically started on
Lecofloxacin for possible PNA. DFA's were negative.  However
there was also concern that her resp status could be effected by
HF, PE, and/or COPD flare.  She had no improvement and give her
recent hosp stays was added gent and vanco for broad coverage.
Despite this she continued to worsen.  She continued to have
periods of hypoxia with fever.  blood and urine cultures were
negaitve.  She worsened with interstitial pattern on CXR and
increased wheezing.  Pt then had episode of sever hypoxia and
required NIMV and was sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BiPAP.  There viral
culture demonstarted parainfluenza.  They also checked CTA which
ruled out any evidence of PE.  Because it was felt the virus was
also causing a COPD flare she was on steroids and responded well
and were tapered slowly.  She then returned to the florr and did
well until she had second decompensation after dialysis with
hypoxia.  She once again required short admission to the MICU
for observation.  Once again a CTA was negaitve for PE.  She was
continued on steroids and completed a 14 day course of
levo/gent/vanco for presumed super infection.  After second ICU
stay returned to the floor and was afebrile, no leukocytosis.
Slowly was weaned off of O2,  Started on MDI for COPD.  On
discharge she was ambulating without supplemental O2 and
maintaining sats.  Sent home on steroid taper with MDI's.

# Visual Changes- Complained of right eye visual problems.  [**Name (NI) **]
by ophtho.  Got MRI head which did not show any stroke or signs
of optic neuritis.  Visual problems felt to be [**2-4**] vasculopathy
(retinal artery ischemia) associated with HTN, diabetes.
Recommmended optimizing regimens for these chronic illnesses.

# DM- Insulin pump was stopped intially and she was started on
lantus and RISS.  She was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] throughout here
stay.  Insulin regimen was adjusted accordingly.  She remained
on this regimen until discharge when her pump was restarted.

# CAD-Pt presented with SOB .  Trop elavated to 3.00 when
baseline had been 0.04, without any significant ECG changes.
She was seen by cardilogy who felt she had  NSTEMI likely [**2-4**]
demand ischemia/[**Month/Day (2) **] failure and recommended optimizing medical
management.  Concern for some myositis [**2-4**] statin so this was
held.  She remained CP free during stay and troponin trended
down.  CShe was continued on BB, aspirin, plavix, imdur, ACEI

# CHF- ECHO done in house showed EF of 50% with mild global
hypokinesis.

# Hypothyroid- Cont on levothyroxine

# Mental Status Changes- Initial CT head showed no evidence of
ischemia, bleed.  Later MRI confirmed this result.  MS changes
felt to be secondary to hypoxia, infection, medications, and
[**Month/Day (2) **] failure.  Her psychiatric meds were adjusted but
ultimately was able to restart them all.  As she imprved from a
respiratory and ID standpoint here mental status gradually
improved and returned to baseline.

# Psych- On multiple pysch meds.  Some were initially held due
to sedating effects.  As her MS improved these were gradually
restarted per psych recs.

# ESRD - SHe remained on schedule of HD on MWFSa.  Followed by
[**Month/Day (2) **] throughout hospital stay.

# h/o seizures- She was continued on phenytoin.  Levels were
checked and doasge adjusted as needed.  No seizures during her
hospital stay.

esterase, 11 to 20 white blood cells, few bacteria, 3 to 5
squamous epithelial cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed ST depressions
in V2 through V5; which was improved two hours later, normal
axis and intervals, normal sinus rhythm, no Q waves.

Chest x-ray was negative for cardiopulmonary processes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
admitted to the C-MED Service for further treatment of her
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  She was given
aspirin, intravenous and p.o. Lopressor, heparin, and
Integrilin in the Emergency Department.

On the floor, she was also started on captopril 6.25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. with good results.  She had no further symptoms during
her hospital stay.

On [**2113-5-9**], she underwent cardiac catheterization which
showed a right-dominant system with severe 3-vessel disease.
The left main had mild disease, left anterior descending
artery with 70% proximal stenosis and 60% distal stenosis
after a large second diagonal.  The left circumflex was
diffusely diseased with a thrombotic 80% stenosis after first
obtuse marginal.  The second obtuse marginal with 50%
stenosis with TIMI-II flow.  Dominant right coronary artery
was diffusely disease with 80% and 90% serial stenoses in the
proximal and middle vessel.

The patient underwent evaluation by Cardiothoracic Surgery
and was deemed appropriate for both coronary artery bypass
graft and mitral valve replacement.  Of note, an
echocardiogram was completed on [**2113-5-10**] showing mild
regional left ventricular dysfunction with severe hypokinesis
of the posterobasal wall.  There was 1+ aortic regurgitation
and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation seen.

2.  ENDOCRINE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a history of diabetes mellitus
times two years.  She was initially treated only with Amaryl
but continued on q.i.d. fingersticks and sliding-scale
insulin.  She was also placed on an American Diabetes
Association cardiac diet.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was to be going to coronary
artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement on [**2113-5-12**].  At that time she will be transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Tobacco history.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications will be discussed in a
later Discharge Summary.

The patient had some difficulties with shortness of breath
and was monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter.  He was noted to
have an increased INR of unknown etiology.  He continued to
have congestive heart failure and was kept in the Intensive
Care Unit for approximately one week, at which time his
bowels began to function.  He was progressed to a diet that
was somewhat tenuous and required close observation.  He was
then sent to the Floor.  There was a small amount of seepage
from the wound, but otherwise, he seemed to recovery
reasonably well.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unable to swallow.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
male with multiple medical problems and recent
hospitalization for left lower extremity ulcer infected with
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient was directly admitted from home for a decreasing
ability to take p.o. secondary to throat pain when
swallowing.  The patient has a history of throat cancer and
status post surgery and radiation therapy.  The patient
denies abdominal pain and nausea but does admit to lack of
appetite.  He says his clothes are fitting loosely and has
apparently lost a lot of weight in the last month or two.
The patient states that he was admitted ""to get a feeding
tube.""

Of note, the patient has old pacemaker wires in his abdomen
which may complicate percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
placement.  The patient is also on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation and reportedly has not taken his Coumadin in
three days.  However, his latest INR drawn on [**3-6**]
was 9.5.  The patient undergoes hemodialysis on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday which should be continued while in the
hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
less than 15% by echocardiogram in [**2108-12-21**].
 2.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis three times per
week).
 3.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarction times two, with percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to the circumflex.
 4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 5.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
 6.  History of ventricular tachycardia; status post
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
 7.  Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis secondary
to amiodarone toxicity.
 8.  Hypertension.
 9.  Status post throat cancer for which he was treated with
radiation therapy.
10.  History of diabetes.
11.  History of colon cancer, status post colectomy.
12.  History of gout.
13.  Hypothyroidism.
14.  Peripheral vascular disease with chronic lower extremity
ulcer.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.,
Colace 100 mg p.o. q.d., Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. q.d., Coumadin
4 mg p.o. q.h.s., Tums 1 tablet p.o. t.i.d., Nephrocaps 1
tablet p.o. b.i.d., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s., pravastatin 20
mg p.o. q.h.s., trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s., Tylenol No. 3
p.r.n., levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.o.d., Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d., vitamin C, and vancomycin (which is dosed at
dialysis).

ALLERGIES:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife at home.  He has
a daughter who is a nurse and extremely involved in his care.
He has no history of tobacco, and no current alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 95.9,
blood pressure of 86/63, heart rate of 88, respiratory rate
of 20, satting 100% on room air.  The patient was a pale,
cachectic male lying in bed, and appeared sleepy.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes
were dry.  Tongue was red and smooth.  Extraocular movements
were intact.  Heart was irregular.  No murmurs.  The point of
maximal impulse was laterally displaced.  Chest had bibasilar
crackles, and a pacemaker was noted in the right upper chest
wall.  The abdomen was soft, normal active bowel sounds,
wires were noted in the right abdominal wall.  Extremities
revealed bilateral pitting edema.  Venous stasis changes
bilaterally.  The patient had a dressing over the left lower
leg.  His toes were cool with nonpalpable dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves were
intact.  The patient was weak but moved all four extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed a white blood cell count of 10.9,
hematocrit of 51, platelets of 189 (70 neutrophils, 4 bands,
12 lymphocytes).  Sodium of 142, potassium of 5.5, chloride
of 104, bicarbonate of 22, blood urea nitrogen of 51,
creatinine of 6.2, blood sugar of 131.  Albumin of 3.2,
calcium of 9.6, phosphate of 4.6, magnesium of 2.1.  Iron
of 100.  INR of 5.1.  Digoxin level of 4.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was quite
complicated and marked by two trips to the Intensive Care
Unit.  Of note, on admission, the patient was noted to be
digoxin toxic, and his digoxin was held throughout his
hospitalization.  There were no electrocardiogram changes
concerning for digoxin toxicity, and the patient was
asymptomatic.  The patient's blood pressure on admission was
notably low, in the 80s/50s.  According to his family, his
blood pressure did run on the low side.  It was felt by the
team that he was severely dehydrated due to poor oral intake
over the past few weeks.  He was gently hydrated due a known
ejection fraction of 10%.

On [**3-8**], status post dialysis, the patient became
hypotensive to the 70s and was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit briefly for further monitoring.  He received more
intravenous fluids at that point.  The Medical Intensive Care
Unit stay was short, and he was called back out to the floor
on [**3-9**].

A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed on
[**3-11**]; and, of note, the patient got 600 cc of lactated
Ringer's intraoperatively as well as Fentanyl.

Overnight, following the procedure, the patient was
persistently hypotensive in the 70s/30s and did not respond
to fluid boluses.  The patient was admitted back to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**3-10**] for hypotension
refractory to intravenous fluids.  The patient was maintained
on a dopamine drip for several days for a blood pressure in
the 90s.  There was some confusion as to his volume status,
not being clear whether he was dehydrated or volume
overloaded, and with his low ejection fraction, he had been
pushed off the Starling curve.

On [**3-15**], the patient was dialyzed off 2 liters of fluid
which then enabled the dopamine to be weaned off.  Again, on
[**3-16**], an additional 2 liters were dialyzed off.  The
patient was stable off dopamine for 24 hours with a blood
pressure in the 90s, and he was transferred out to the floor
on [**3-16**].

The patient initially was stable on the floor but was noted
to have increasing tachypnea over [**3-17**] and [**3-18**].  On
[**3-19**], upon evaluation by the team, the patient was
increasingly tachypneic, more somnolent, and was feeling very
poorly to the point where he said, ""I just want to die.""  An
arterial blood gas was done and revealed an acidosis with a
pH of 7.22, a PCO2 of 50, and a PO2 of 129 on 4 liters nasal
cannula.  A STAT chest x-ray revealed a large right-sided
pleural effusion, and when compared with previous x-rays was
read as increasing bilateral effusions, right greater than
left.   The effusion was drained by ultrasound guidance by
the Radiology team, and approximately 1.2 liters were taken
off.  The patient had improved respiratory status after and
appeared more comfortable.  Fluid studies were pending at the
time of this dictation.

Other issues during this hospitalization included his
nutritional status.  The patient was originally treated with
intravenous fluid hydration as noted above prior to
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.

A gastrojejunostomy tube was placed by Interventional
Radiology on [**3-11**] without any complications.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was immediately started on
.................... for tube feeds.  This was changed to
Nepro on [**3-19**] due to his renal failure.  The patient
continued to tolerate tube feeds well and will be sent home
on Nepro tube feeds with a goal of 50 cc per hour.

The patient's renal status was basically stable throughout
this hospitalization.  He continued to be dialyzed on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.  There were no complications.

Infectious Disease issues included continuation of Flagyl,
levofloxacin, and vancomycin for his left lower extremity
ulcer.  The Vascular team did come by and see the patient and
recommended continuing wet-to-dry dressing changes b.i.d. as
well as to keep pressure off the leg.  The patient was kept
in multipoultice boots to prevent further skin breakdown.

Hematologic issues included the need for reversal of his
supratherapeutic INR which was 9.2 on admission.  On the
first two days of his hospitalization the patient received
several doses of p.o. vitamin K to help reverse his INR.  The
patient was kept off Coumadin status post percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement during his Medical
Intensive Care Unit stays and was restarted on Coumadin on
[**3-18**].  His INR will need to be followed closely.

Social and disposition issues during this hospitalization
included the overall goals of care.  Initially, the patient
and family were very adamant that he should be full code and
wanted everything done.  It became more clear to the family
and the patient during this hospitalization that he was very
sick and had multiple medical problems.

On [**3-19**], after a thoracentesis, the patient and family
had a discussion with the attending and the decision was made
to change the patient to do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
The plan was to send the patient home with services.  Further
discussions about goals of care may be carried out with the
attending at a future date.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  End-stage renal disease.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 15%.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease with chronic left leg ulcer

Service:  UROLOGY

ADDENDUM:  Since the last dictation the patient developed
chest pain starting below the sternum that was dull in
quality that was 6 out of 10 in intensity.  The initial
electrocardiogram did not show any significant signs of
ischemia, however, follow up electrocardiogram showed a
diffuse ST changes and pericarditis.  The patient states he
has had a history of pericarditis in the past and that the
pain was similar to that episode.  The patient was started on
Motrin 800 mg three times a day to continue for a maximum of
ten days or three days after the resolution of his symptoms.
The patient also had an echocardiogram, which showed no signs
of pericardial effusion and good EF greater then 55%.  The
patient also had a head MRI to evaluate for increasing
weakness in the left side.  The MRI showed that there was no
significant change compared to the prior MRI and the findings
were consistent with postoperative changes and there was no
new enhancing lesions.  Thus on postop day number nine the
patient was able to ambulate without difficulty and was
having bowel movements, tolerating po medications without
difficulties and was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for further
continual laboratory checks request by the renal service and
to continue to monitor his resolution of pericarditis and
symptoms of chest pain.

New medications added to the previously dictated medication
list are Ibuprofen 800 mg po t.i.d. for a maximum of ten days
or three days after the resolution of the symptoms of chest
pain.

In addition to the discharge instructions, please have
laboratories checked every day of chem 10, ionized calcium
and CBC until Friday and every other day until follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2164**].  Please fax these results to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2598**].  Please
leave the Steri-Strips on until they fall off.  The patient
may shower.  No baths.  No driving.

Service:  ACOVE

This is a continuation of the hospital course from the
previous discharge summary related to this admission.

1. Pulmonary:  The patient continued to have an oxygen
requirement during this period.  It decreased over the course of
several days to the point, where he was on nasal cannula and only
face tent for moisture and was not requiring frequent suctioning.
The patient then had a G-J tube placed by Interventional
Radiology on [**2168-9-2**].  He did well immediately following the
procedure.  But over the next two days, developed increasing
hypoxia and increased oxygen requirement and required more
frequent respiratory suctioning.

The question of an aspiration pneumonia was raised on [**2168-9-4**]
and the patient was started on clindamycin in addition to the
levofloxacin that he had been continued on presumed pneumonia
from earlier in the hospital course.  The patient will continue
to be treated with aggressive chest PT and respiratory suctioning
in an attempt to reduce his oxygen requirement somewhat.  At this
time, his antibiotics will be continued as well.  Patient also
seems to benefit from scopolamine patch, which has now been
placed.  Nebulizer treatments do not seem to make a huge
difference for this patient.

2. FEN:  There were extensive discussions with family and the
patient's primary doctor about whether to place a new feeding
tube after it was determined that the original tube placement was
into a large hiatal hernia in the stomach and would be too great
of risk for aspiration.  The family decided to have the new
feeding tube placed and a G-J tube was placed by Interventional
Radiology on [**2168-9-2**].

In the interim, the patient had received a standard TPN mixture
for nutrition through a PICC line in his left arm. Tube feeds
were restarted on [**2168-9-4**] and had been gradually advanced with
success.  The PICC line was removed on [**2168-9-4**] due to phlebitis.
This phlebitis seemed to coincide with a slight worsening of the
patient's condition with a slight fever and an increase in his
white count, which seems to be resolving now that the PICC line
has been removed.  The plan is to increase tube feeds to the goal
of 60 cc/hour, and that the patient will be able to return to his
normal tube feeding regimen once he is discharged back to the
[**Location (un) 2762**] facility.

3. Hematuria:  On [**2168-9-3**], the patient developed some slight
hematuria noted in his Foley bag.  A urinalysis was sent and
showed large amount of blood in the urine as well as several
white blood cells, but no bacteria.  On [**2168-9-5**], the decision
was made to remove the Foley catheter and with the presumption
that if the blood was from irritation from a Foley catheter being
well in for well over a week.  The patient is on antibiotics that
should cover a urinary tract infection at this time.

4. Atrial fibrillation:  Patient has been continued to be
rate controlled by beta blockers, IV metoprolol when no p.o.
access was available, and now the patient has been started
back on his p.o. metoprolol of 25 twice a day as well as his
digoxin at 0.125 once a day.  The patient is on Lovenox for
anticoagulation and is being reloaded with his Coumadin and
his outpatient dose of 5 and 5.5 alternating every other day.

This concludes the dates of [**2168-8-27**] to [**2168-9-5**].  An
additional discharge summary addendum will be added to cover
any further events and the patient's discharge disposition,
condition, instructions, medications, and diagnoses.

Admission Date:  [**2168-8-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-9-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2102-1-15**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Acove

ADDENDUM:  To previous discharged summary related to this
admission and covers the dates of [**2168-9-7**] to [**9-11**]. [**2167**].

1.  Pulmonary - The patient continued to have an oxygen
requirement during this period but by the date of discharge
he had been weaned down to 2 liters by nasal cannula and 40%
by face tent.  He was requiring much less frequent suctioning
and though he continued to have chest physical therapy daily,
he was bringing up relatively little sputum.  Overall, he was
doing much better from a respiratory standpoint.  The patient
completed his entire course of Levofloxacin for pneumonia.
The patient, however, will continue with his course of
Clindamycin for presumed aspiration pneumonia as this course
will finish on [**2168-9-13**].  The patient does continue
from a Scopolamine patch which can be continued as needed
once he has returned to [**Location 2762**].

2.  Hypotensive episode, the patient had a hypotensive
episode on [**2168-9-5**].  He appeared to be
intravascularly dry at this time and may have become septic
as well or may have responded to an aspiration event.  He
required normal saline fluid resuscitation to which he
responded well.  At this time the patient had also lost a
PICC line.  A new PICC line was placed at this time and
remained in place.

3.  Anemia - At the same time the patient hematocrit dropped
from 41 to 39 the next morning to 33 the following morning to
27 that evening.  In talking with the family and medical team
it was decided not to aggressively seek the source of the
decrease in hematocrit.  The patient did receive a unit of
packed red blood cells at the time of that incident and the
hematocrit responded appropriately and he maintained this
hematocrit throughout the remainder of his stay.  His
anticoagulation had been stopped when the hematocrit drop was
noticed, though he was maintained on heparin subcutaneously.
His Warfarin was restarted on the night of [**2168-9-11**]
at his outpatient dose.  Once the patient became therapeutic
on Coumadin, he can have his subcutaneous heparin discontinued.

4.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient achieved
goal tube feeds of 60 cc/hr on Promote with fiber.  At the
time of discharge he was transitioned from [**11-26**] normal saline
at 50 cc/hr to free water boluses through his jejunogastric
tube.

5.  Atrial fibrillation - The patient was continued on Digoxin
and metoprolol.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To an extended care facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient should have his hematocrit checked within
three days of discharge as he was anemic in the hospital
without a clear source.
2.  The patient should continue to receive heparin
subcutaneously until he is therapeutic on Coumadin.
3.  The patient should have chest physical therapy each day
until he is free of secretions.
4.  We are sending the patient with a PICC line in place so that
he may finish his course of Clindamycin.  After the antibiotics
are finished, the PICC line should be removed.
4.  The patient should have his INR monitored upon admission
until Coumadin is therapeutic and then monitored thereafter
with target range 2.0-3.0.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg twice a day, hold for systolic blood
pressure less than 120.
2.  Ativan .5 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.
3.  Albuterol nebulizer every 6 hours as needed.

7.  Clotrimazole 1% cream topically twice a day to affected
areas.
8.  Tylenol 325 to 650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.
9.  Heparin sodium 5000 units/ml, injection subcutaneously
every 12 hours, until the patient is therapeutic on Coumadin
10. Scopolamine 2.5 mg every 72 hour, patch q. 72 hours as
needed for secretions

Admission Date:  [**2163-8-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-9-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2087-5-9**]     Sex:  M

Service:

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  ORTHOPEDIC:  The patient underwent cervical spine fusion
anterior and posterior on [**2163-8-26**].  There were no
immediate complications post procedure and the patient was
extubated without difficulty.
2.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient was noted to be confused on
[**8-27**], with increased tangential speech and increased
agitation.  The patient was evaluated by the Neurology
Service on [**2163-8-28**].  At that time, it was felt that the
patient's change in mental status was most likely secondary
to a diffuse encephalopathy versus a more frontal syndrome.
Neurology recommended a metabolic and endocrinologic work-up
which was negative.
3.  RESPIRATORY:  On the evening of [**2163-8-28**], the patient
developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
intubation and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further management.  Chest x-ray at that time showed
small lung volumes with a questionable infiltrate in the left
lower lobe. The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure was
felt to be secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic
right diaphragmatic paralysis.  This acute exacerbation was
believed secondary to either manipulation of cervical nerve
roots at the time of cervical spine surgery versus pneumonia
versus congestive heart failure.

The patient was intubated until [**2163-9-1**], at which time
sedation was weaned down and the patient was extubated;
however, approximately four hours post extubation, the
patient was noted to have increased respiratory rate to the
high 30s with decreased total volumes, although saturation
was at 100%.  The patient was placed on a BiPAP at settings
of 15 out of 5 at which time his arterial blood gas was 7.34
/ 42 / 119.  The patient also was noted to have markedly
elevated blood pressures with a systolic blood pressure
maximum of 240.  Given that the patient appeared in danger of
complete respiratory failure, the patient was re-intubated.

The patient remained re-intubated for several days while
attempts were made to better control his blood pressure to
improve his chance of success following a second trial at
extubation.  The patient was extubated for a second time on
[**2163-9-6**], and transitioned directly to BiPAP with pressure
support of 12 and PEEP of 5.  The patient tolerated
extubation well although he continued to produce copious
amounts of oral and pulmonary secretions requiring frequent
suctioning.

Over the next several days, the patient was alternated
between a BiPAP and shovel mask until at the day of
discharge, the patient was tolerating being off of BiPAP all
day to rest on BiPAP overnight from 10 p.m. until 06:00 a.m.
The patient was noted post-extubation to have poor gag and
cough response, although his gag and cough improved over the
course of the next several days.  The patient was not felt to
be able to handle his own secretions or to safely swallow
pills or food.

An nasogastric tube was placed on [**2163-9-8**], through which
the patient received tube feed boluses, 250 cc five times a
day, and medications.  The patient was scheduled for a speech
and swallow evaluation on the day of discharge.

The patient will require swallowing retraining at the
pulmonary rehabilitation center.

4.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient remained persistently
hypertensive throughout the course of hospital stay.  After
frequent readjustments of medications and dosing, the patient
will be discharge on Metoprolol, Captopril, and Hytrin.  It
is believed that there is a large component of anxiety
contributing to the patient's hypertension and although the
patient had received benzodiazepines and Fentanyl to control
his hypertensive spikes, his agitation appeared to settle
down post extubation and at the time of discharge the patient
was not requiring benzodiazepines or Fentanyl boluses.

5.  ANEMIA:  Prior to transfer to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 27.6 post surgery.  The patient's
hematocrit initially bumped to 34.5, but continued to drift
downward over the course of the hospital stay.  The patient
remained guaiac negative without any evidence of bleeding at
his incision site.

The patient's baseline hematocrit runs between 28 and 32.  He
has been worked up in the past with findings consistent with
anemia of chronic disease.  The patient's hematocrit
continued to be monitored throughout the course of hospital
stay with a transfusion threshold of less than 21.

6.  STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTEREMIA:  On [**2163-9-8**], the
patient was noted to have low grade temperature to 100.4 F.,
with increased white blood cell count to maximum of 13.6.
Blood cultures were drawn at this time which grew two out of
four bottles positive for Gram positive cocci in clusters,
later identified as Staphylococcus aureus.  Sensitivities of
Staphylococcus aureus cultures were pending at time of
discharge.

The patient was initiated on Vancomycin given prolonged
hospital stay with intubation and the patient is planned for
a 14 day course of Vancomycin and a PICC line was placed on
day of discharge.

7.  PNEUMONIA:  The patient was diagnosed on initial chest
x-ray on [**2163-8-28**], with a possible left lower lobe
pneumonia which appeared to worsen over the course of the
next several days.  The patient completed a 14 day course of
Levofloxacin.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   Discharged to an acute rehabilitation
facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg p.o. q. four to six hours

Please see the prior dictation summary for the history of
present illness, past medical history, social history, and
family history as well as the hospital course through
[**2163-9-12**].

Hospital course [**2163-9-12**] through [**2163-9-23**]:
Pulmonary:  On [**2163-9-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an episode of
bradycardia secondary to hypoxia with mucus plugging with
newly more copious secretions.  Patient was emergently
reintubated for the third time since admission.  Patient was
also treated with a 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA in
sputum and blood (ending [**2163-9-19**]) and a seven day course of
Zosyn (ending [**2163-9-20**]) for gram-negative rods on sputum Gram
stain in the setting of increased sputum production (although
the rods never grew out in the sputum).

The patient received a trache [**2163-9-14**].  The trache was
changed for a #1 Shiley, nonfenestrated, [**9-22**] as the #6 was
too flexible and would [**Doctor Last Name **] out with patient movement.
However, the new trache may not allow adequate speech
production - may require alteration.  The patient did not
tolerate a trial of trache mask [**9-18**] (acidemic) and [**9-21**]
(acidemic, hypoxic, bradycardic, and hypotensive, required 1
mg of atropine to revive).  Patient is stable and PFV is [**6-30**]
(10 on a.m. of discharge) and PEEP of 5.

Infectious disease:  The patient received a 10 day course of
Vancomycin for MRSA and blood in sputum (ended [**2163-10-19**]) and
seven day course of Zosyn (ended [**2163-9-20**]) for gram-negative
rods on sputum Gram stain in the setting of increased sputum
production (although, again, the rods never grew out in the
sputum).  Patient also grew Enterococcus in urine which was
also sensitive to Vancomycin.  Finally, patient is day [**7-31**]
in a course of Flagyl for Clostridium difficile.  Patient is
afebrile during the period from [**2163-9-13**] to [**2163-9-23**]; patient
was febrile to 103.3 in the a.m. of [**2163-9-12**].

Gastrointestinal:  Patient's bowel function was maintained
using Colace, Senna, and lactulose (standing hold for loose
BMs).  Patient received PEG on [**2163-9-20**] without complication.

Cardiovascular:  Patient's hypertension controlled with
metoprolol, captopril, and Hytrin.  Patient occasionally
hypotensive for second dose of captopril, hold for systolic
blood pressure less than 100.

Endocrine:  Patient's diabetes mellitus type 2.  Serum
glucose well controlled with 4 units of NPH q.a.m., 5 units
of NPH q.p.m. with regular insulin-sliding scale.

F/E/N:  Patient maintained on continuous tube feeds through
his PEG.  Patient has diminished gag reflex and is not - as
of time of discharge - taking p.o.

Renal:  Patient without known renal pathology.  Creatinine
ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 through this period.  Medications
renally dosed depending on creatinine level.

Psychiatric:  Patient has baseline depression treated at home
on sertraline.  Patient also had continued delirium agitation
particularly at night after [**2163-9-12**].  Patient was originally
treated with propofol, Zyprexa, and Ativan.  However, due to
sedation, propofol was weaned and Zyprexa increased [**9-15**],
with Ativan prn.  Trazodone was also added q.h.s. on
[**2163-9-16**], with Fentanyl added [**9-17**], for continued agitation.

Finally psychiatric consult was sought and recommended
discontinuing all psychiatric medications - including
sertraline - and controlling delirium with Haldol 5 t.i.d.
with prn doses offered q.1h.  Patient's agitation well
controlled on this regimen, with a few prn doses required.
Patient is much more alert and oriented; avoid oversedation.

ADDENDUM:

CONTINUATION OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has had a cough during the
course of her admission since we started her on ACE inhibitor
and we thought this might be the cause.  By the end of her
stay at the hospital, we switched her to Losartan, starting
her off at a 25 mg dose.  She had been on Lisinopril 40 mg
and will likely require titrating up as an outpatient on
Losartan.  The patient originally came in with pulmonary
edema, but that resolved very quickly with Lasix.  Her
PA-diastolic at her first catheterization was 15, and after
that point, we stopped diuresing her with Lasix.

It was noted that her lung examination was very crackly and
at times we thought we required further diuresis.  We placed
a Swan-Ganz catheter during the course of her hospital stay.
The [**Location (un) **] had capillary wedge pressure of 9 and a
PA-diastolic of 16; therefore, diuresis was deemed
unnecessary.  We are discharging the patient without a
standing dose of Lasix as her lung examination appears to be
at baseline and she does not appear to be requiring a
standing dose of diuretic.

The patient should be followed up by a cardiologist.  It is
unlikely that she will benefit from further interventions in
the future, therefore she should maximized with her current
medical regimen of blood pressure medications and aspirin.
She will take Plavix for 30 more days, at which point she
should begin anti-coagulation for stroke prophylaxis.  She
should take aspirin at a dose of 81 mg to reduce the
potential for bleeding.

2.  Pulmonary:  On admission, the patient had a chest x-ray
that showed asymmetric pulmonary edema with a right
predominance.  After diuresis, there was some resolution,
however, the asymmetric edema still remained.  During the
course of her admission, the asymmetric pulmonary edema
gradually resolved by chest x-ray, however, her lung
examination was suggestive of large amounts of upper airway
congestion and some diffuse rales.

The patient had a CT scan of the chest done on [**6-1**],
which showed no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion
in the chest and no focal consolidations noted.  There were
no evidence of pulmonary masses or nodules.  The patient has
been coughing during the course of her hospital stay and on
discharge has been changed from ACE inhibitor to Losartan,
however, this may not be the cause of her coughing, and she
may deserve further work-up on a Pulmonary standpoint as an
outpatient.

Whether the etiology of her long-standing shortness of
breath, which has been going on for two months, is purely
cardiac is unknown and she may have some unknown pulmonary
components present.

3.  Renal:  During the course of her admission, her BUN and
creatinine remained stable.  Her electrolytes were repleted
as necessary but there were no active renal issues.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient initially had elevated
white blood cell count and a temperature of 101.2 F.,
however, this was deemed secondary to stress and steroid use.
She was observed clinically and became afebrile and her white
blood cell count fell without any antibiotics.  There was no
active Infectious Disease issues.

5.  Polymyalgia rheumatica/temporal arteritis:  The patient
had been on high dose Prednisone in the relatively near
future.  At the beginning of admission, she was placed on
stress-dosed steroids, Dexamethasone 4 mg every eight hours.
Her steroid dose was gradually weaned down and she will be
discharged on a standing dose of Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q. day
for her temporal arteritis.

6.  Hematologic:  The patient's hematocrit initially fell
post-cath but then remained stable.  She had no active
bleeding during the course of her admission and at the second
catheterization her hematocrit remained stable.  At the time
of discharge, her hematocrit was stable at 32.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient is stable at time of
discharge.  She is alert and oriented.  She has no bleeding
from her femoral line site from the catheterization.  Her
hematocrit and electrolytes were stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The caseworker is trying to arrange for a
rehabilitation facility, cardiac rehabilitation versus home
services for the patient.  She lives at home with her husband
and may require services in the future.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pulmonary edema.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post catheterization with
stenting of left anterior descending.
3.  Temporal arteritis.
4.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Losartan 25 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day times 30 days.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Guaifenesin with codeine, 5 to 10 ml p.o. q. six hours
p.r.n. for cough.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  The patient is to follow-up with her primary care
physician in one to two weeks.
2.  She will be followed by Cardiology at [**Hospital1 960**].
3.  She will require cardiac rehabilitation in four to six
weeks.

Primary care physician is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4963**] [**Doctor Last Name 4964**].

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to a previously dictated
Discharge Summary.

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of
schizophrenia who was admitted to [**Hospital1 4242**] with a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant
syndrome and was subsequently placed on intravenous fluid
hydration and had a negative Infectious Disease workup with a
negative chest x-ray, and lumbar puncture, and blood
cultures.  However, the patient was found to have a positive
urinalysis with enterococcus and was treated with amoxicillin
for a 10-day course.

The patient was subsequently discharged to an inhouse
psychiatric facility for treatment of her schizophrenia due
to the fact that all of her medical issues had resolved.  She
had a normal creatine kinase upon discharge with a value of
191 and a normal BUN and creatinine with a value of 8/0.6.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Her condition upon discharge revealed
the patient was eating, ambulating, and urinating, and
defecating spontaneously without assistance.  The patient was
able to converse.  However, the patient still had some
evidence of delirium and would subsequently be transferred to
an inpatient psychiatric unit for initiation of antipsychotic
medication and monitoring for improvement and clearing of
post neuroleptic malignant syndrome delirium.

This is an addendum to the previously dictated discharge
summary dictated on [**2178-8-9**].

Prior to discharge, the patient experienced of multiple
episodes of bilious emesis.  Estimated to about 900 cc.
Radiograph imaging was consistent with small bowel
obstruction, and nasogastric tube was placed approximately
700 cc of brown bilious drainage was suctioned from
nasogastric tube.

General Surgery was consulted for evaluation for possible
surgical intervention.  Given that the KUB showed dilated
loops of small bowel diffuse and air down to the rectum.  The
patient was switched to NPO, given nasogastric tube, and
hydrated with intravenous fluids, as well as with Dulcolax
enemas.

Outpatient cardiac and pulmonary medications are
................. two IV in the interim.  Given the patient's
right groin hematoma, CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to
evaluate for underlying etiology for this small bowel
obstruction with a question of retroperitoneal hematoma.  A
CT scan at this time showed a normal small bowel with no
evidence of obstruction, dilated sigmoid colon, no free air,
no free fluid, and no evidence of volvulus, and no
retroperitoneal bleed.

Within 48 hours of this presentation of partial bowel
obstruction, the patient did have a bowel movement.
Subsequent the nasogastric tube was clamped with low residual
volume, and then was discontinued later that evening.  The
patient tolerated a clear liquid diet and was advanced to a
full regular diet with improvement of all symptoms.  Prior to
discharge, the patient was tolerating a regular diet with no
nausea, vomiting, or other abdominal complaints.

During this time, the patient had two episodes of
nonsustained V-tach that lasted seven beats and eight beats
respectively.  Given patient's recent MRI with unknown
ejection fraction, EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] with regards to
.................. possible ................ placement given
risk factors.

Upon discussion, EP recommended starting patient on low dose
beta blocker, metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] despite patient's severe
history of congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.  Patient
was monitored closely after receiving beta blocker with no
complaints of any respiratory systems or changes in
difficulty breathing.  The patient otherwise remained stable
throughout the hospital stay.

Respiratory - On [**12-18**], because of his persistent oxygen
requirement and the evolvement of chronic lung disease, a
single dose of Lasix was given to Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **] with hope
of clinical improvement.  The oxygen requirement, however,
did not improve.  Due to his good growth status at the time
intake to 130 cc/kg/day.  We believe due to his good growth
status his decreased caloric intake would actually not play a
big role in his growth.  We hope that this input will help
decrease the progression of his chronic lung disease.  We
opted to do this in place of starting him on diuretic
therapy.

have increasing episodes of apnea and occasional
desaturations.  Her oxygen requirement had been only
minimally elevated.  In the time since the last discharge
addendum, she had been doing well on the Neurology service,
however, she spiked a temperature to 102.1 on the morning of
the 15th.  Urine cultures were notable for yeast, and she was
started on fluconazole 100 mg once daily.

Her chest x-ray showed no new changes and CT of the head
showed no new changes.  However, she continued to spike
fevers, and she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for
presumed aspiration pneumonia.  At that time, she was
transferred to the Medical ICU for further evaluation.

Later that night her blood pressure dropped with hypotension
down to systolic 60s/diastolic 40s.  She was given
intravenous fluids with good effect.  Triple lumen catheter
was placed into the left femoral vein.  She required no
further fluids that night, but her blood pressure medications
were held including Lopressor 100 mg 3x daily.  Her Lopressor
was decreased to 75 mg 3x daily accordingly.

The next morning the patient was noted to have arrested with
ventricular fibrillation.  Shocks were held secondary to
family's wishes.  Time of death was 8:31 a.m.  The family
declined autopsy and the attending was notified.

This will serve as a discharge summary addendum to the
previously dictated discharge summary.

ADDENDUM:  FEN:  The patient was started on clear liquids
earlier in this admission and progressed to full liquids and
ultimately to house diet with Boost supplements.  She had a
calorie count at the end of her admission which showed she
was taking in excess of 300 calories per day orally.  The key
to her nutrition was Boost supplements which she would take
b.i.d.  She preferred chocolate shakes.

In addition, the patient developed phlebitis around her left
arm and the peripherally inserted central catheter site.
Ultimately, it will be detailed below.  The PICC needed to be
removed.  She was on PPN for approximately one day.  However,
by the next day her calorie count was completed and it was
clear she did not need parenteral nutrition.  She will be
discharged with an oral diet that should include Boost
supplements t.i.d. between meals.

Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis:  The patient
developed erythema and tenderness around her PICC insertion
site.  The left upper extremity was subsequently imaged with
a Doppler ultrasound which showed a nonocclusive thrombus
around the PICC line.

At this point the PICC line was removed.  The following day
the patient had another image of her left upper extremity
which showed residual clot.  Given the fact that the patient
had no symptoms of either local swelling or PE, the patient
was not anticoagulated.  The patient should have repeat
ultrasound at some point next week to follow improvement of
the clot.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Xeloda toxicity.

VT arrest.

Metastatic breast cancer.

Left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Loperamide 2 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. diarrhea.
3. Toprol XL 300 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Keflex 500 mg one capsule p.o. q. 6 hours times three more
   days.
5. Sarna lotion one application q.i.d. p.r.n.
6. Reglan 5 mg q.i.d. a.c. and h.s. p.r.n. nausea.
7. Multivitamin one cap p.o. q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old female
patient who was admitted to an outside hospital Emergency
Department for chest pain approximately three days prior to
admission associated with arm heaviness and nausea and
vomiting.  She was subsequently discharged home, but the pain
recurred two days later.  She presented to her primary care
physician on [**2113-5-8**] and was noted to have ST changes
on her electrocardiogram, which was obtained in the office
and she was sent to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 960**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, significant smoking
history approximately 120 pack years.  She has peripheral
vascular disease and is status post right iliac stent for a
nonhealing ulcer on the right heel.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Amaryl 1 mg po b.i.d., Maxzide,
Cosopt eye drops and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of
19.[**2111**], hematocrit 40.6, platelet count 295, sodium 129,
potassium 2.8, BUN 28, creatinine 1.5 and glucose of 174.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Medicine Service.  She subsequently ruled in for myocardial
infarction.  She was placed on Integrilin drip.  She was also
treated with aspirin and heparin.  She went to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on [**2113-5-9**] where she was
found to have three vessel coronary artery disease.  An
echocardiogram at that time revealed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 50%.  The patient was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2113-5-12**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three
with a mitral valve repair with a 26 mm ring.
Postoperatively, the patient was on Milrinone, Amiodarone,
neo-synephrine and insulin intravenous drips and was
transported to the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit.  The patient had some supraventricular
dysrhythmias throughout the operation and was placed on
Amiodarone for that reason.  The patient was extubated on
postoperative day two, however, she remained very lethargic
and difficult to arouse.  She was noted to hve no movement of
her right arm.  A head CT was obtained at that time, which
was essentially negative.  The patient was reintubated on
postoperative day three due to increase work of breathing and
tachypnea and enteral tube feeds were initiated at that time.

On [**5-16**], postoperative day four the patient underwent a
bronchoscopy for copious secretions.  She was noted to have
purulent secretions and cultures of those secretions grew out
Moraxella for which she was placed on Levofloxacin and has
completed a ten day course of that.  On the [**5-17**] a
Neurology consult was obtained due to continued flaccidity of
the right arm with intermittent movements of the legs noted.
Neurologists initially believed this to be a central cord
syndrome versus a small cerebrovascular accident.  CT of the
head remained essentially negative.  The patient was placed
in a soft cervical collar until spinal cord compression was
ruled out.  The patient had another bronchoscopy the
following day for copious amounts of secretions and she was
subsequently extubated.

The following day the patient was reintubated for decreased
mental status and increased respiratory distress.  CT of her
head was repeated on [**5-19**], which was again negative.  At
this point the Neurology Service strongly recommended an MRI
to determine what the pathology was causing her neurological
examination.  MRI of the head and neck were obtained and
revealed multiple small fossae posterior infarcts, basilar
artery infarcts, mild basilar artery stenosis and no spinal
cord compression.  The patient was started the following day
on a low dose heparin drip for her stroke and basilar artery
stenosis.  It was the Neurology Services recommendation to
keep her systolic blood pressure above 120.  The patient was
again extubated on the [**5-22**].  At that time she was
more awake and able to cough and clear her secretions.
However, later in the day the patient was subsequently
reintubated again for continued increased respiratory rate
and work of breathing.  She also had copious secretions,
which she became unable to clear possibly due to fatigue.

On [**5-24**] the patient was noted to have an increase in
white blood cell count.  She was fully cultured.  Her central
line was discontinued.  She had a double lumen PICC line
placed.  Her arteriole line site was changed.  She underwent
a bronchoscopy again due to copious secretions and she had a
percutaneous tracheostomy performed at the bedside as well as
a PEG for feeding purposes.  The following day the patient's
white blood cell count peaked at 45,000.  She had some minor
abdominal tenderness and went for chest, abdomen and pelvis
CT scans, which were all negative.  Hematology consult was
obtained at that time since there was no apparent source of
infection due to increasing white blood cell count.  The
patient did have a remote history of lymphoma and the
question was brought up as to whether the white blood cell
count was in some way related to the lymphoma.  The
Hematology Service did not feel this was in any way related
to her lymphoma and thought that we should continue to rule
out an infection source.  The Infectious Disease Service was
consulted and they recommended discontinuing her antibiotics,
because they could find no obvious source of infection.

The patient has had some diarrhea and she has had two
negative C-difficile examination on her stool.  The patient
was intermittently placed on low dose neo-synephrine around
the [**5-26**] for one to two days due to some mild
hypotension in the one teens in attempts to keep her systolic
blood pressure higher, because of her neurologic status.
Tube feed was reinitiated on [**5-26**].  She also had
intermittent bouts of atrial fibrillation with controlled
ventricular response.  The following few days the patient
became more awake and interactive with her family.  She
expressed significant depressive symptoms to her family.  She
was subsequently started on Celexa, however, this was
discontinued after approximately three days due to increasing
lethargy.  The patient remains on a heparin drip and on the
[**5-28**] was placed on a trach collar and taken off the
ventilator.  She appeared to be doing well from a respiratory
standpoint.  Her Lopressor was increased due to a heart rate
in the 90s.  She was begun on NPH insulin since she had been
tolerating her tube feeds well at this point.  Her
antibiotics were discontinued.  The Hematology Service had
signed off since her white blood cell count had subsequently
been coming down over the last few days.

On the [**5-29**] the patient was noted to hve increased
lethargy, decreased responsiveness and was placed back on the
ventilator due to worsening work of breathing with a PACO2 of
63.  This was corrected as soon as she was placed on the
ventilator.  The patient became more alert.  On [**5-30**] the
patient underwent a repeat MRI of her head and neck at the
request of the Neurology Service, which showed no change from
her previous study.  The patient was also noted on chest
x-ray after being placed back on the ventilator to have a
left pleural effusion.  She underwent a thoracentesis on
[**5-30**] for approximately 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
Repeat chest x-ray showed reexpansion of the lung with no
pneumothorax.  The patient has remained hemodynamically
stable and is ready to be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility for continued stroke rehabilitation, physical
therapy, speech therapy and weaning from the ventilator.

Most recent culture data, on [**5-22**] the patient had one
positive blood culture drawn from a peripheral A line for
coag negative staph.  However, she subsequently had three
blood cultures, which were negative and the line was
discontinued upon receiving the information of the initial
positive blood culture.  The patient's central intravenous
catheter on [**5-24**] cultured negative.  The patient had a
gram stain of her sputum on the 18th, which was gram positive
coxae, but the culture subsequently revealed no bacteria and
some sparse growth of yeast.  The patient remains afebrile at
this time with no antibiotics with a decreasing white count.
Other recent laboratory values from [**5-29**] revealed a white
blood cell count of 16.9, which has come down to 16.0 today
on [**5-30**].  Hematocrit 30.2, platelet count 206,000.  PTT
this morning on 1100 units per hour of heparin was 116.  The
heparin was discontinued for one hour and resumed at 900
units per hour with a subsequent PTT pending.  Her potassium
this morning is 4.4, glucose 214.  She remains on the
ventilator in the CPAP mode at 40% FIO2 with pressure support
of 10 and PEEP of 5.

The patient's physical examination today, neurologically the
patient is very lethargic.  She had decreased movement of her
right arm, otherwise has spontaneous movements of her left
arm.  She also has intermittent decreased movements of her
right leg.  Coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her abdomen
is soft, nontender with her PEG tube in place.  Her
extremities are warm and well perfused.  She has a small area
of the saphenous vein harvest site in her right thigh area,
which is nonhealing that is requiring Santal ointment to be
placed to the area.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 5 mg per G tube q.d. with a
target INR of 2.0.  She is being anticoagulated for basilar
artery stenosis per the Neurology Service.  Lasix 40 mg per G
tube q.d., Protonix 40 mg per G tube q.d., Colace 100 mg per
G tube b.i.d. this has been held for the past day or two due
to increase in stools.  Cosopt eye drops to both eyes b.i.d.,
Lumigan 0.03% to both eyes q.h.s., aspirin 325 mg per G tube
q.d., Albuterol nebulizers treatments q 4 hours and prn,
Lopressor 25 mg per G tube b.i.d. to be held for a heart rate
less then 60 or a systolic blood pressure less then 110.  She
is receiving NPH insulin 10 units subcutaneously b.i.d.  This
will have to be assessed on an ongoing basis due to the
patient's nutritional status as she begins to take in more
calories.  She is also on a sliding scale regular insulin.
Coverage for blood sugar of 150 to 200 she gets 3 units of
regular insulin subcutaneously for, 200 to 250 she gets 6
units, 250 to 300 she [**Last Name (un) 17927**] 9 units subcutaneously.  The
patient as previously noted been on Celexa due to apparent
clinical depression, however, this was discontinued due to
decreasing level of responsiveness, increase in lethargy.
This should also be readdressed as the patient recovers from
her stroke and cardiac surgery to be determined whether she
is appropriate to be placed on an anti-depressant.

The patient is to follow up here at [**Hospital1 4242**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1477**]
upon discharge from the rehabilitation facility or to be
called for any concerns related to her surgery.  The patient
is being followed by the Neurology/[**Hospital 9879**] Clinic here at [**Hospital1 1294**].  She is to follow up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in one month from now at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 17928**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve repair.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft times three.
3.  Respiratory failure/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
status post tracheostomy.
4.  Cerebrovascular accident.

ADDENDUM:  There is a very detailed Discharge Summary that
has already been dictated through the first of [**2109-3-20**].
The purpose of this Discharge Summary is to indicate that the
patient eventual date of discharge was [**2109-3-23**].

The patient's discharge status was expired.

Of note, between the prior Discharge Summary and this current
Discharge Summary is the fact that the patient changed his
code status from full code to do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.  The patient subsequently decided, in conjunction
with his family, they agreed to have his cardiac pacemaker
deactivated.  He similarly agreed to withdraw from any
further dialysis treatment.  The patient then met with a
Palliative Care representative and decided that he wanted to
become ""comfort measures only"" status.

As such, vital signs and laboratories were no longer checked.
The patient received Ativan for agitation and morphine for
air hunger and was found to be unresponsive on the [**2109-3-23**].  The time of death was 7:20 a.m. on [**2109-3-23**].

Therefore, the patient's discharge status was expired, and
this Discharge Summary serves as an update from the prior
Discharge Summary which details his hospital course through
[**2109-3-20**].  The patient's family was aware of the patient's
death, and they were present in the hospital, and appropriate
arrangements for the patient's body were made by the family.
The family declined an autopsy.
